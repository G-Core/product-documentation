### **What happens during review**

#### **1. NOC receives the request**

- The NOC team receives an approval request.
- Your submission is added to the review queue.

#### **2. NOC reviews the request**

The NOC team checks the following:

- Network details (CIDR format).
- AS Number validity.
- Letter of authorization (LOA) document.

The team verifies that all information matches the submitted data.

#### **3. NOC makes a decision**

- If your request is approved, you receive an email notification.
- If your request is rejected or additional information is required, you receive an email with details.

### **Email notification**

If your request is approved, you receive an email with the following information:

- Confirmation of approval.
- Approved AS number.
- Approved network (CIDR).
- Instructions for the next steps.

### **What to do while waiting**

- Monitor your email for the approval notification.
- Ensure you have access to the customer portal.
- Prepare your GRE endpoint information (if available).

## Network Configuration
### **Overview**

After your request is approved, configure your protected network by setting the GRE endpoint and selecting a protection profile.

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Log in to the portal**

- Access the customer portal.
- Go to **DDoS Protection** → **Protected Networks**.

#### **2. Locate your approved network**

- Find the network with the **Inactive: need info** status.

#### **3. Configure network settings**

In the **edit protected network** view, configure the following:
