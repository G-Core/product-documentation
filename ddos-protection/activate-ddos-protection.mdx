We provide DDoS protection for [Bare Metal](https://gcore.com/cloud/bare-metal-servers) and [Dedicated Servers](https://gcore.com/hosting/dedicated). You can also get DDoS protection for equipment that's not hosted by Gcore.

<Info>
**Info**

After we set up the DDoS protection, the main IP of your server will be changed for Hosting. It will stay the same for Bare Metal.
</Info>

## Activate protection for a Gcore server

There are two options for setting up DDoS protection services: 

  * Apply predefined protection profiles. 
  * Request custom configuration. This is the only option available for the [Hosting](https://gcore.com/hosting) platform.



The predefined profiles are available on the **Network** tab in your server settings. For example, the following screenshot depicts the profile settings for Bare Metal:

If no predefined protection profile aligns with your requirements, contact the [Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to request a custom configuration.

In your request, include the following information: 

  * Server ID 
  * Filled DDoS questionnaire



### DDoS questionnaire

Complete the following questionnaire according to your infrastructure setup and DDoS protection requirements. 

<Tip>
**Tip**

All fields in the questionnaire are optional, but we recommend providing as much information as possible to help us configure DDoS protection settings that are best optimized for your infrastructure.
</Tip>

**1\. Destination data and protection of additional services**

For each destination that you want to protect, list the IP, port, and protocol.

Do you want to configure DNS protection? |   
Do you want to configure RegEx-based filtering? |

## Activate protection for a third-party server

For detailed configuration instructions, refer to the [Configure your infrastructure for Secure Transit](/ddos-protection/super-transit/configure-super-transit) guide. 

## Rent a new dedicated server with DDoS protection

The configuration for a rented dedicated server is almost identical to the activation of a DDoS protection for an existing server.

The key difference is that you first need to select and order the preferred configuration in the [Dedicated Servers](https://gcore.com/hosting/dedicated) section of our website. After that, proceed with the same configuration steps that are outlined in the [Activate protection for a Gcore server](/ddos-protection/activate-ddos-protection#activate-protection-for-a-gcore-server) section. 

## Deactivate DDoS protection

To deactivate your server's protection, contact the [Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com). We will stop the service. Note that the main IP of your server will be changed after deactivation.
