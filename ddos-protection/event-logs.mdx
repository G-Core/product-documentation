title: "DDoS event logs"
---

The DDoS event logs inform you about ongoing attacks and create an archive for retrospective analysis. They enable you to enhance your overall security posture by reviewing past incidents in depth, identifying trends, and strengthening your defences accordingly.

The event logs provide details about **DDoS attacks of the past three months** and contain the following crucial information about each attack:

- **Date**: The date and time the event was detected.
- **Event**: The type of event (e.g., DDoS Attack, RTBH).
- **BPS**: Bits per second at the time of attack detection.
- **PPS**: Packets per second at the time of attack detection.
- **Target IP**: The IP address targeted by the attack.
- **Unique Source IPs**: Number of unique source IP addresses involved in the attack.

An example event log looks like this:
