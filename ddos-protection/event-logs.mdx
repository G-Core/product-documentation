The DDoS event logs inform you about ongoing attacks and create an archive for retrospective analysis. They enable you to enhance your overall security posture by reviewing past incidents in depth, identifying trends, and strengthening your defences accordingly.

The Event Logs provide details about **DDoS attacks of the past three months** and contain the following crucial information about each attack:

  * Start date and time
  * Bits per second (BPS)
  * Packets per second (PPS)
  * Attacked IP address
  * Number of attacking IP addresses
