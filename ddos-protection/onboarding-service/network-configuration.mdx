### **3. Configure network settings**

In the **Edit protected network** view, configure the following:

- **GRE endpoint**
  - Enter your GRE (generic routing encapsulation) endpoint IP address.
  - This is the IP address where traffic will be tunneled.
  - Example: `203.0.113.1`
- **Protection profile**
  - Select a protection profile from the dropdown list.
  - Default option: only the **Basic** protection profile is available initially.
  - You can create custom profiles later.

### **4. Save the configuration**

- Review all settings.
- Click **Save changes** to apply the configuration.

<Note>
  Note

  - The **Basic** profile provides standard DDoS protection.
  - You can create and apply custom protection profiles later.
  - Changes take effect immediately after saving.
