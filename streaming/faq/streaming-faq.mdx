- Anti-DDoS, WAF/WAAP, global edge protection  
- SLA, QoE observability, and priority support  


### Can you bill per GB instead of per minute?

Yes. But per-GB billing is available via custom enterprise CDN plans only.  
Please contact your account manager to enable this option.


### Is usage calculated in seconds or minutes?

All usage is measured in seconds internally and then aggregated and displayed in minutes for billing clarity. Rounding up to the nearest integer is used.


### How are services charged?

For billing terms and conditions, please see the separate section [Streaming usage and billing metrics](/streaming/how-the-streaming-platform-and-additional-features-are-billed).


### How can I estimate usage and pricing?

You can calculate a rough monthly estimate using the Streaming Platform pricing calculator.

It covers the full workflow:
- Transcoding (included by default),
- Storage for VOD and recorded live streams,
- CDN delivery, based on viewing time.

To estimate costs, enter:
- total video duration,
- expected number of viewers,
- average watch time per viewer.

The calculator automatically generates an estimated monthly price, including optional add-ons.

More details: https://gcore.com/pricing/streaming-platform

For enterprise customers with custom CDN plans, pricing is calculated individually — please contact your account manager.


### What video qualities are included in free transcoding?

Free transcoding includes multi-bitrate encoding up to Full HD (1080p) for both horizontal and vertical (mobile) video.

Available qualities include:
- LQ — Low Quality  
- SD — Standard Definition  
- HD — High Definition  
- FHD — Full HD  

More details: [
Output parameters after transcoding](/streaming/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/output-parameters-and-codecs#output-parameters-after-transcoding).


### Why does billing show more minutes than I actually watched?

Billing is based on data delivered, not only on what was watched.

If a player buffers video segments, those segments are delivered by the CDN and therefore billed. For example, if 30 seconds of video are buffered but playback stops after 1 second, the full 30 seconds are still counted as delivered.


### Why is video usage billed in minutes instead of GB?

Minutes are the clearest and most predictable unit for video usage. Video duration is fixed, while file size in GB varies significantly depending on codec, bitrate ladder, resolution, frame rate, and encoding profile.

Gcore uses a single unified storage model for each video asset. This storage includes:
- video and audio streams,
- all transcoded renditions,
- metadata, thumbnails, previews, and technical artifacts.

Because storage is shared across all representations, billing per GB would be misleading. Minute-based billing reflects real video usage more accurately.

Benefits of per-minute billing
- Free multi-bitrate transcoding  
- Unified storage for the entire video entity  
- Delivery billed by actual viewing duration  

For enterprise customers who require it, per-GB pricing is also available.

## Live Streaming FAQ

### Can I go live directly from a browser?

Yes. Using WebRTC WHIP, you can publish directly from a browser or browser-based app that captures camera and microphone input.

You can also start a stream directly from the Customer Portal dashboard or integrate streaming into your own UI via API/SDK.


### Can I broadcast a pre-recorded video as live?

Yes. This is supported via Live Imitation (Simulated Live / Playout).

Upload a VOD asset and schedule it to run as a live stream, creating a real-time viewing experience.

If you need to publish this stream to social platforms, it can be combined with restreaming.

More details: [Simulated live from VOD](/streaming/video-hosting/create-an-illusion-of-a-live-broadcast-with-uploaded-videos)


### Can I restream my live stream to social platforms?

Yes. Restreaming (simulcasting) is available as an add-on service (€0.10 per stream under 24 hours).

Send one contribution stream and distribute it simultaneously to platforms like Facebook while serving viewers through Gcore.

More details: [Restreaming](/streaming/live-streaming/create-and-configure-a-restream-to-social-media)


### Can I use multiple audio tracks in live streams?

No. Live streams currently support one audio track only (AAC stereo). Multi-track or multi-channel audio is not supported at this time.

More details: [Input parameters and codecs](/streaming/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/input-parameters-and-codecs#recommended-video-parameters)


### Can viewers rewind or pause a live stream?

Yes. The DVR (time-shift) feature allows viewers to pause and rewind live streams while the broadcast continues.

More details: [Pause and rewind live streams](/streaming/live-streaming/pause-and-rewind-the-live-streams)


### Do you support 2-way video calls or conferencing?

No. Gcore does not support direct WebRTC-to-WebRTC communication.

The platform focuses on one-to-many delivery at scale using HTTP-based protocols (LL-HLS, LL-DASH). Direct WebRTC relay is not supported anymore.


### Do you support WebRTC ingest?

Yes. Gcore supports WebRTC ingest via WHIP, with transcoding to LL-HLS / LL-DASH for scalable delivery.

More details: [WebRTC ingest (WHIP)](/streaming/live-streaming/protocols/webrtc)


### What is the maximum duration of a live stream?

- One-time live streams: up to 24 hours  
- Continuous streams: 24/7/365, available with the 24/7 transcoding option (enabled via your manager)


### What latency can I expect for live streams?

All live streams are low-latency optimized by default, delivering approximately 2–4 seconds glass-to-glass using LL-HLS or LL-DASH.

For legacy HLS MPEG-TS workflows (`.m3u8` / `.ts`), a reduced-latency mode of ~9 seconds is available to maximize compatibility.

More details: [How low latency streaming works](/streaming/live-streaming/how-low-latency-streaming-works)


---

### Are live streams recorded automatically?

Yes. With the Record feature enabled, live streams are automatically saved to Streaming Storage and become available for playback or export after the broadcast ends.

More details: [Record live streams](/streaming/live-streaming/record-your-live-streams-and-save-them-as-videos)

---

### Is there a free trial for live streaming?

Yes. A 14-day free trial includes 30 minutes of storage/encoding to test the workflow.

For extended testing, please contact us.

## VOD FAQ

### Can I use external storage (e.g., my own S3)?

No. External storage for original files is not supported.


### Do you keep my original uploaded file?

No. Original files are automatically deleted after transcoding.

You can download any transcoded rendition (SD, HD, Full HD) in MP4 format.

More details: [Download files](/streaming/video-hosting/original-files)


### How can I migrate my video library?

Videos must be re-uploaded to Gcore Streaming, where they are automatically transcoded. Bulk and API-based migration tools are available, and assistance can be provided if needed.

More details: [Batch upload and migration](/streaming/video-hosting/upload-video-via-api#batch-upload-to-migrate-a-vast-number-of-videos-from-other-services)


### What qualities do you support?

Available output video quality is up to 8K HDR.

## Troubleshooting & Support

### General troubleshooting steps

If you encounter issues such as video not playing, slow startup, or blurry quality, perform these basic checks:

- **Status page**: Check for known service interruptions at [status.gcore.com](https://status.gcore.com).
- **Source validation**: Ensure the source content is valid. If the issue exists in the source, re-upload the video or restart the stream.
- **Settings audit**: Verify that the stream is enabled and that all URLs and embed codes match those provided in the Customer Portal.
- **Client-side checks**: Clear browser cache, disable extensions, and ensure a stable network connection (test with/without VPN).
- **Network**: Verify that streaming ports are open on your firewall and that your device OS/browser is up to date.

### Why do I see an HTTP 502 error?

This usually indicates a configuration mismatch between the CDN and the streaming origin:
- **CDN Presets**: If CDN resource settings were modified manually away from the Gcore presets, the handshake may fail.
- **Token Sync**: If secure tokens are enabled but not synchronized correctly, the edge will reject the request.

Please contact [support](mailto:support@gcore.com) to restore these settings.
