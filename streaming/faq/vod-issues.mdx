Here are some common issues you may encounter when working with VOD and steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

## 503 error after transcoding

_Possible cause_: Upload has been interrupted by closing or reloading the window.\
_Suggested solution_: Try uploading again and be careful not to interrupt the process. If the video is more than 500 MB, the upload will resume where it left off.


## Video is not uploaded

_Possible cause_: Upload has been interrupted by closing or reloading the window.\
_Suggested solution_: Try uploading again and be careful not to interrupt the process. If the video is more than 500 MB, the upload will resume where it left off.

_Possible cause_: Not enough storage space to complete the upload.\
_Suggested solution_: Confirm in the Storage statistics that you have used up your storage. Contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to increase the storage space.


## Upload to the Gcore Customer Portal is interrupted by a session timeout (force logout)

_Possible cause_: Video is too large to upload through UI.\
_Suggested solution_:

- Upload during late night or early morning hours when there is less load on the queue.
- Upload a small batch of videos (e.g., 10 at a time).
- [Upload via API](https://gcore.com/docs/streaming-platform/video-hosting/upload-video-via-api).


## Upload is stuck in the Processed state for a long time

_Possible cause_: Processing queue is too long or loaded with large videos.\
_Suggested solution_: Wait a while and then try uploading again.

## Video returns an HTTP 404 error

A 404 error typically indicates that the transcoding process is still in progress (initial segments haven't been generated yet), or the requested video asset does not exist.

For a complete list of 404 error descriptions and other responses, please refer to our [HTTP status codes](/streaming/faq/http-status-codes) guide.

## Source video issues

If your video is blurry, stuttering, or has no audio, first check the original file.  
_Suggested solution_: Play the original source file on your local machine. If the issue is present there, you must correct the source file and re-upload it. Gcore Streaming preserves the quality of the input, so any defects in the source will be visible in the transcoded renditions.
