## Video and live streaming statistics

Statistics data is collected only when you use the standard player. 

The **Reports** page shows information about [videos](https://streaming.gcore.com/video/list) and [live streams](https://streaming.gcore.com/streaming/list): viewers, their browsers and operating systems, geography, popular videos (only for the **Video** page), as well as URLs of pages that host a player with your video. The data is updated every five minutes and stored for one year. 

You can check reports for all videos and live streams or only for a single one. To see overall statistics: 

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **Streaming** > **Reports**. 

2\. Choose the relevant subsection: **Built-in player: VOD** or **Built-in player: Live**. 

2\. Select the preferred interval (24 hours, 48 hours, week, or month) and dates.

3\. Choose one or more parameters: **Browsers**, **Geography**, **Hosts**, **OS**, or **Viewers**.

### Parameters overview

  * **Viewers** : The number of viewers. We collect the following information about their behavior: 

    * **Uploads** : Shows how many times users opened a video or live stream page.
    * **Starts** : Indicates how many times users clicked the **Play** button.
    * **Viewers** : Specifies how many viewers have watched a video or a live stream for at least 5 seconds.
    * **Unique viewers** : Represents the number of unique viewers (we distinguish viewers using several parameters at once: an IP address, screen size, browser, and cookie).

  * **Popular videos** (available only for videos): A list of the most viewed videos. We consider only views that are longer than five seconds. 

  * **Browsers** : Statistics on browsers that your viewers use to watch your video/live stream.

  * **OS** : Statistics on users' operating systems. 

  * **Hosts** : Static data on the URL of requested pages. We consider only views that are longer than five seconds. The `"streaming.gcore.com"`. URL means a video was watched from a personal account. 

  * **Geography** : A world map that highlights countries where your viewers watch videos/live streams for at least 5 seconds. A user's IP address determines a country.
