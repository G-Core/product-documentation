Here are some common issues you may encounter when working with VOD and steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

## Video is not uploaded

_Possible cause_: Upload has been interrupted by closing or reloading the window.\
_Suggested solution_: Try uploading again and be careful not to interrupt the process. If the video is more than 500 MB, the upload will resume where it left off.

_Possible cause_: Not enough storage space to complete the upload.\
_Suggested solution_: Confirm in the Storage statistics that you have used up your storage. Contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to increase the storage space.

## Upload to the Gcore Customer Portal is interrupted by a session timeout (force logout)

_Possible cause_: Video is too large to upload through UI.\
_Suggested solution_:

- Upload during late night or early morning hours when there is less load on the queue.
- Upload a small batch of videos (e.g., 10 at a time).
- [Upload via API](https://gcore.com/docs/streaming-platform/video-hosting/upload-video-via-api).

## Upload is stuck in the Processed state for a long time

_Possible cause_: Processing queue is too long or loaded with large videos.\
_Suggested solution_: Wait a while and then try uploading again.
