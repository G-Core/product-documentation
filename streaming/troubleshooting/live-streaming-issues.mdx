Common issues you may encounter when working with Live Streaming, as well as steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

## Current broadcast contains DVR chunks of the previous broadcast

_Possible cause_: The broadcast is over, but the stream has not been stopped.  
_Suggested solution_: This is a normal behavior.

To avoid this situation:
 - Stop the stream when the broadcast is finished.
 - Delete the DVR archive before starting a new broadcast.


## Low-latency streaming is buffering

_Possible cause_: Perhaps end-user's public internet speed and quality aren't sufficient to download data in a timely manner.
_Suggested solution_: For such users, provide an alternative viewing experience: display /master_mpegts.m3u8 link (HLS non-low-latency manifest URL from UI) in your player or add an attribute `?no_low_latency` to our built-in player.

 - [Built-in player](/streaming/extra-features/customize-appearance-of-the-built-in-player#no-low-latency)


## Manifest is empty and stream is not working

The stream is sent to ingester normally, ffmpeg or OBS show correct info. But the manifest .m3u8 is empty and the stream is not shown.

_Possible cause_: The master stream is being sent with network problems, or the encoder settings are set incorrectly.
_Suggested solution_: Our low latency solution has a latency of 4-5 seconds. If the delay is more than 5 seconds:

Check the graphs for the relevant stream in your personal account under "Monitoring." Frames per second, Interval between key frames, and Bitrate should be stable. If you see breaks in the graph, this means your stream is being sent from your encoder with issues.

Check your encoder's latency and settings. See the relevant sections in the documentation:
 - [Input parameters of your live streams and videos](/streaming/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/input-parameters-and-codecs)
 - [Use RTMP protocol](/streaming/live-streaming/protocols/rtmp)
 - [Use SRT protocol](/streaming/live-streaming/protocols/srt)
 - [Use broadcasting software (ffmpeg, OBS, Streamlabs, etc)](/streaming/live-streaming/broadcasting-software/)


## Picture is falling apart

When you see this picture, it means there is packet loss in the network from your encoder to our ingester.

![Picture is falling apart](/images/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/falling-apart.jpg)

_Possible cause_: Packet loss during delivery from your encoder via SRT.
_Suggested solution_: Try sending from another network of another provider, and also reduce the bitrate of the master stream plus set SRT latency explicitly.

Read more about latency in section [SRT Latency](/streaming/live-streaming/protocols/srt#srt-latency).


## Stream is frozen or buffered

When the player stops and starts showing running dots or a clock.

_Possible cause_: Packet loss during delivery from your encoder via RTMP.
_Suggested solution_: Try sending from another network of another provider, and also reduce the bitrate of the master stream.

Read more about recommended input parameters in section [Input parameters](/streaming/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/input-parameters-and-codecs). Set et the minimum specified values ​​or even lower (You won't lose much quality, but you'll still get the broadcast).
