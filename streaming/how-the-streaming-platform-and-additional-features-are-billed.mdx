## Billing

### Billing overview

For a general understanding of how billing works across all Gcore services — including billing cycles, invoices, payments, committed volumes, and overage handling — refer to the Billing Overview section in the main Gcore documentation.

Read first: [Billing overview](/billing)


### Billing schedule

Billing dates, payment processing, and suspension rules are described in the general Gcore billing documentation.

For details, see: [Billing overview](/billing)


### Limits and committed volumes

Some tariff plans include a committed monthly volume provided at a committed price. If your actual usage exceeds this committed volume, the additional consumption is billed according to the overlimit rates.

The PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) plan has no committed volume and provides full platform functionality. Billing is purely usage-based — you pay only for what you consume.

In all tariffs there are no limits on the number of streams or viewers. You can deliver any number of live streams or VOD assets to audiences of any size. All streaming components scale automatically with your demand.

Default limits apply only to storage:
 - Transcoding: no limit
 - Video storage: up to 100,000 minutes (~5 TB) by default (can be increased by contacting your manager)
 - CDN delivery: no limit
 - AI services: no limit


### Tariff plan and terms

You can acquaint prices for streaming resources on the [Gcore website](https://gcore.com/pricing/streaming-platform).

By default, all tariffs include core service components: 
- **Transcoding** — processing of VOD assets and live streams into adaptive multi-bitrate formats  
- **Storage** — unified storage for video assets and live stream recordings, including metadata and previews  
- **Delivery** — video delivery to end users via the CDN  
- **AI services** — AI-powered video processing such as speech recognition and content moderation  

Enterprise customers may use custom plans with tailored terms, pricing models, and service conditions.

Your current tariff plan and billing terms are described in your plan, which is located in the Streaming section:

### What happens if my account is suspended?

When an account is suspended, all services are temporarily disabled. During this period, video transcoding and content delivery are unavailable.

Your video assets remain stored in storage for up to one month. If the account is restored within this timeframe, your video library will be reactivated without any changes or data loss.

## Usage and billing reports 

### Billing reports

The [Reports / Billing](https://portal.gcore.com/streaming/statistics/usage) page provides detailed insights into resource consumption across the Gcore Streaming Platform. These reports are used to calculate usage and form the basis for billing.

The following billing reports are available:
- Computer vision - number of minutes processed by AI services 
- Delivery minutes – number of minutes spent delivering video via the CDN
- Real-time video – (obsolete) minutes delivered via WebRTC-to-WebRTC 
- Simultaneous streams – number of live streams being transcoded concurrently
- Transcoding, minutes – total minutes spent transcoding live streams and VOD assets
- Video hosting, minutes – occupied storage volume for VOD assets, measured in minutes
- Video hosting, volume in GB – occupied storage volume for VOD assets, measured in gigabytes

Some reports may be unavailable if the corresponding service is not enabled for your account.

### Computer vision

AI-powered video processing such as speech recognition and content moderation are displayed here. The number of minutes spent processing the video is displayed.

The total number of minutes accumulated during the month is included in billing.

This report is available only for customers/enterprise customers if AI services are enabled.


### Delivery minutes

All video content is delivered to end users via the CDN.

This report shows the total number of video delivery minutes processed through the CDN. For visibility and analysis, delivery statistics for live streams and VOD assets are displayed separately in the report. However, in the final invoice, delivery usage is aggregated and presented as a single line. 

The total number of minutes accumulated during the month is included in billing.

</Frame>

For enterprise customers: 
- Enterprise plans may apply different rules; please contact your account manager for details. This report includes statistics only for video-specific CDN resources that measure delivery in minutes. Such resources typically use the base domain
{your_id}.gvideo.io.
- If you use custom CDN resources billed per GB for video delivery, usage and billing are handled separately under your CDN plan and reflected on the CDN Billing page. In this case, the Delivery minutes report will show statistics only for traffic served from the base video domain.


### Simultaneous streams

This report displays the maximum number of live streams being transcoded concurrently for each day.

For standard live streaming tariff plans and workflows, it allows you to monitor how many streams were running at the same time and identify peak concurrency during the selected period.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/docs/streaming-platform/billing/billing-streams.png" alt="Billing Simultanious Streams" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
</Frame>

For enterprise customers:
- If 24/7 stream transcoding is enabled, this report displays the maximum number of streams being transcoded simultaneously.
- The maximum number of simultaneously transcoded streams within the billing period is used for billing calculations and included in the monthly invoice.


This report is available only for enterprise customers.


### Transcoding, minutes

All video content (both live streams and VOD assets) is processed through the transcoding service to generate adaptive multi-bitrate renditions suitable for delivery across different devices and network conditions.

This report shows the total number of minutes spent on transcoding during the selected period. For monitoring purposes, transcoding usage for live streams and VOD assets may be displayed separately. The total number of transcoding minutes accumulated during the month is included in billing and appears as a single aggregated line item on the invoice.

This report includes statistics only for transcoding operations performed by the Streaming Platform. Basic transcoding profiles up to Full HD (1080p) are included by default, while additional profiles or advanced configurations may be billed according to your tariff plan.

The total number of minutes accumulated during the month is included in billing.

For enterprise customers:
- Enterprise plans may apply custom transcoding terms or accrual models. For details, please contact your account manager.


### Video hosting, minutes

This report reflects the total duration of VOD assets stored on the platform, calculated per minute of the original uploaded file.

Billing for video hosting is based on video duration, not file size. We use minutes because it is the most transparent and predictable metric for video content. While file size in GB can vary depending on encoding settings and bitrate ladders, the length of the video remains constant.

You pay only for the duration of the original video. Additional encoded versions of ABR are not charged.
For example, if a 1-minute video is transcoded into five different bitrates, it is still billed as 1 minute.

<Info>
The report displays the maximum amount of video stored per day. For billing purposes, the highest number of stored minutes reached during the month is used.
</Info>

Example:
If you upload 5,000 minutes of video on the 1st day of the month and delete all assets on the 2nd day, the monthly billing value will still be 5,000 minutes, as this was the peak storage usage during the billing period.

For enterprise customers:
- Enterprise plans may apply custom storage terms or accrual models. For details, please contact your account manager.


### Video hosting, volume in GB

This report shows the total storage consumption measured in gigabytes (GB). Unlike minute-based accounting, all stored data is counted by size, including:
 - all transcoded renditions,
 - audio tracks,
 - metadata,
 - thumbnails, previews, and other auxiliary files.

Billing is based on the actual storage volume occupied, not on video duration.

<Info>
The report displays the maximum storage volume reached per day. For billing purposes, the highest storage volume recorded during the month is used as the final value. See the metric above for example.
</Info>

This report is available only for enterprise customers using tariff plans with video hosting billed per GB.
