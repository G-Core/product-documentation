Projects are goal-specific folders where you can create Edge Cloud products including Virtual Machines, volumes, and networks. Each project acts as a separate environment; its resources are isolated from the resources in any other project. You can control access to these resources by specifying user permissions on a per-project basis. 

You can view projects in the Gcore Customer Portal via either the **Project** dropdown or the **Cloud Management** page.

## View projects in different layouts

You can change the layout on the **Projects** page to display the information in two ways:

  * **List view**. Presents all projects as a concise list with only the project name and description displayed.

## Create a project

When you first navigate to the Cloud page, you'll have only one **Default** project. This project is created automatically for every account and can't be deleted. 

You can create more projects to organize your cloud resources. The number of projects doesn't affect your expenses, you only pay for resources used.

To create a project:

1\. Navigate to the **Projects** page.

2\. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select **Create project**.


<Frame>![The Projects page with the Create project button highlighted](/images/docs/cloud/getting-started/projects/create-a-project/create-project.png)</Frame>



3\. Enter your project name. Optionally, add a description. 

<Info>
**Info**

A project name can contain between 3 and 63 characters, including Latin letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, spaces, and dots. The name can't end with a hyphen.
</Info>

4\. Click **Create project**.

## Manage projects
