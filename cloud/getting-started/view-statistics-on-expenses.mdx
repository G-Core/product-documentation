You can check information about Cloud resource usage and associated costs on the following pages: 

  * **Cost Report** : view costs for the Cloud resources you've used. This report shows data based on the Pay-As-You-Go pricing model and doesn't include any costs associated with the prepaid resources (active commit features). 
  * **Reservation Cost Report** : check monthly resource usage and costs for both consumed and pre-paid resources.



You can also get reports via [API](https://api.gcore.com/docs/cloud#tag/Cost-Reports/operation/CostReportResourcesHandler.post).

Consider that statistics for the last hour might contain incomplete data. For accuracy, we recommend reviewing cost information that was collected more than an hour ago. 

## Cost Report

<Info>
**Info**

This report doesn't contain information about prepaid resources. If you have any resource reservations, check the [Reservation Cost Report](/cloud/getting-started/view-statistics-on-expenses#reservation-cost-report) for accurate cost data.
</Info>

This report contains data about each Cloud resource you've used, which also allows you to forecast pay-as-you-go expenses more accurately. 

You can filter the cost data by: 

  * **Project** : View costs for all your projects or just the selected ones. 

  * **Region** : Check costs for products created in all regions or just the selected ones. 

  * **Resource type** : View costs for the selected resource types. 

  * **Consumption period** : View costs for a week, two weeks, or a custom period. Consider that the maximum period you can select is one month.




The report also contains statistics for deleted projects and regions. To include resource costs from deleted projects, select the **Show deleted projects** checkbox.

You can also choose to add inactive projects and regions from the relevant dropdown menu:

You can also check more granular statistics on the following tabs: 

  * Total balance used 
  * Resource usage in hours 
  * In Gigabyte-minutes by resources 
  * In Gigabyte-seconds by resources 
  * Millions of pieces
  * Gigabytes of used resources 
  * The total number of outbound GBs and hours of using different flavors

You can refine resource-related information by filtering it according to resource type and attributes, and narrow down the table results via search.

<Info>
**Info**

Currently, we only support full-text search.

## Reservation Cost Report

This report presents information about your prepaid and [reserved](/cloud/getting-started/resource-reservation/about-resource-reservation) resources, active commits, and costs for pay-as-you-go services. 

Contrary to the Cost Report, the Reservation Cost Report doesn't show statistics for individual resources and you can only view total data collected for each month. 

You can filter cost data by: 

  * **Region** : Check costs for products created in all regions or just the selected ones. 
  * **Resource type** : View costs for the selected resource types. 
  * **Consumption period** : View costs for a particular month.



The report also contains statistics for deleted projects and regions. To include costs from deleted projects, select the **Show deleted projects** checkbox. Alternatively, select inactive projects and regions from the relevant dropdown menu. 


<Frame>![Projects dropdown](/images/docs/cloud/getting-started/view-statistics-on-expenses/projects-dropdown-reservation.png)</Frame>



You can view cost data both as a chart or as a table, which contains more detailed information. In the chart view, the **Total** tab displays the cumulative costs associated with reserved Cloud resources.
