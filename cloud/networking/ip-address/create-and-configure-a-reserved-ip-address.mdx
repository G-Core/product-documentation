A reserved IP is a dedicated address that can be assigned to a [Virtual Machine](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance), [Bare Metal server](/cloud/bare-metal-servers/create-a-bare-metal-server), or [Load Balancer](/cloud/networking/create-and-configure-a-load-balancer). It exists independently of resources, can be pre-configured in DNS or firewall rules, and remains valid when reassigned. A reserved IP can also be used as a [Virtual IP address](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-virtual-ip-vip-address).

## Overview

After a reserved IP is created, this address is exclusively allocated within the Gcore system. No other account can use it. The IP can be assigned to a resource or kept unassigned for future use.

## Billing

The monthly price for the IP is displayed in the order window. Billing applies only for the time from creating an IP to deleting it.

If an IP is reserved and deleted after an hour, charges apply only for that hour. The price remains the same whether the IP is assigned or not.

## Reserve an IP address

To create a new reserved IP:

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **Cloud** \> **Networking**.

<Frame>
  ![Networks page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/networks-page.png)
</Frame>

2. Open the **Reserved IPs** page.

<Info>
  A project can have up to 1000 reserved fixed IP addresses that are not attached to any resource.
</Info>

3. Click **Reserve new IP**.

<Frame>
  ![Reserved IPs page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/reserved-ips-page.png)
</Frame>

4. In the **Network** field, select the network where the IP address is reserved. Available options include:

- **Any shared network** that has been shared with the project
- **External networks** (public networks for internet-facing IPs)
- **Private networks** (internal networks within the project)
- **Dedicated public networks** (if configured for the project)

The regional external network for the current region is automatically filtered out from the available options.

<Info>
A reserved private IP can only be used in the specified subnetwork. To request a specific address, in the **IP address to reserve** section, select **Custom** and enter the IP that belongs to that subnetwork.
</Info>

5. (Optional) In the **IP Family** section, select the IP version: **IPv4**, **IPv6**, or **Dual (IPv4 + IPv6)**.

6. Click **Reserve IP**.

## Assign a reserved IP to a VM

  <Tab title="After VM creation">
    1. In the Virtual Machine settings, open the **Networking** tab.

    <Warning>
If the machine is already connected to the target subnetwork, detach it first before assigning a new IP. This removes the existing IP from the interface.
</Warning>

    2. Add a new interface (public or private) and enable the **Use reserved IP** toggle.

    3. Select the reserved IP and click **Add**.

    The IP will be assigned to the Virtual Machine.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure the network interface in the operating system

Manual configuration is required only when adding a private interface to an existing VM or Bare Metal server.

Find the interface name, IP address, and CIDR in the **Networking** tab. The gateway is the first usable IP in the subnet (`10.10.0.1` for `10.10.0.0/24`).

<Frame>
  ![Network interface details in VM settings](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/vm-interface-details.png)
</Frame>

To identify the new interface, run `ip link show` and match the MAC address shown in the portal.

## Detach a reserved IP from a VM

Detaching is required before reassigning the IP to another resource or deleting it.

1. Open the Virtual Machine settings.
2. Go to the **Networking** tab.
3. Expand the interface that contains the reserved IP.
4. Click the three-dot menu next to the subnetwork row.
5. Select **Detach Subnetwork**.

</Frame>

## Assign a reserved IP to a load balancer

A reserved IP can only be assigned during Load Balancer creation.

<Warning>
The IP becomes the frontend address and is tightly bound to the frontend network interface. It cannot be changed after provisioning.
</Warning>

For instructions, refer to the [Load Balancer creation](/cloud/networking/create-and-configure-a-load-balancer#step-4-configure-network) guide.

## Find a resource with reserved IP

The **Status** column on the **Reserved IPs** page shows if an IP is attached to a resource:

<Frame>
  ![Reserved IPs page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/attached-to-instance.png)
</Frame>

Click the resource name to view and update its settings.

## Delete a reserved IP

After verifying that the IP is no longer attached to any resource, it can be deleted:

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **Cloud** \> **Networking**.

<Frame>
  ![Networks page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/networks-page.png)
</Frame>

2. Open the **Reserved IPs** page.
3. Click the three-dot icon next to the target IP.
4. Select **Delete**.
