Reserved IPs are dedicated IP addresses that can be assigned to [Virtual Machines](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance), [Bare Metal servers](/cloud/bare-metal-servers/create-a-bare-metal-server), or [Load Balancers](/cloud/networking/create-and-configure-a-load-balancer).

## What a reserved IP is used for

Since you know the IP address in advance, you can pre-configure your services for it—for example, create a DNS record for this IP or configure the server to connect to it.

A reserved IP can also be used as a [virtual IP address](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-virtual-ip-vip-address).

## How it works

After you create a reserved IP, this address becomes yours inside our system. No one can use it except you.

## How it is charged

The monthly price for the IP is displayed in the order window. You pay only for the time from creating an IP to deleting it.

For example, if you had reserved an IP and then deleted it after an hour, you will be charged only for an hour of use. The price remains the same whether the IP address is assigned to a Virtual Machine or not.

## Reserve an IP address

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **Cloud** \> **Networking**.

<Frame>
  ![Networks page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/networks-page.png)
</Frame>

2. Open the **Reserved IPs** page.

<Info>
  **Info**

  You can have up to 1000 reserved fixed IP addresses that are not attached to any resource in your project.
</Info>

3. Click **Reserve new IP**.

<Frame>
  ![Reserved IPs page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/reserved-ips-page.png)
</Frame>

4. Select the IP type:

- Public (for external network). A public IP address can be created immediately.
- Private (for internal network). If you selected this option, choose the network and subnetwork in which the address will be created.

<Info>
  **Info**

  A reserved private IP can only be used in the specified subnetwork. To order a specific address, enable the **Set IP address** toggle and enter the IP that belongs to that subnetwork.
</Info>

5. (Optional) If you want to use IPv6 addresses, turn on the **Enable IPv6 dual-stack** toggle.

6. Click **Create**.

## Assign a reserved IP to a VM

  <Tab title="During VM creation">
    For instructions on how to add a Reserved IP when creating a Virtual Machine, refer to the [VM creation](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance#step-5-add-network-interfaces) guide.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After VM creation">
    1. In the Virtual Machine settings, open the **Networking** tab.

    If the machine is already connected to the target subnetwork, detach it first before assigning a new IP. This will remove the old IP.

    </Frame>
    2. Add a new interface (public or private) and enable the **Use reserved IP** toggle.

    </Frame>
    3. Select the reserved IP and click **Add**.

    The IP will be assigned to the Virtual Machine.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Info**

  If you add a private interface after creating a Virtual Machine, you may need to configure it manually on some operating systems. The OS cannot automatically detect and apply the new interface settings, especially for Bare Metal servers. If your VM has an IPv6 address, it will be configured automatically without additional setup.
</Info>

## Configure the network interface in the operating system

When you add a new private network interface to an existing Virtual Machine or Bare Metal server, the operating system may not automatically configure it. You need to manually assign the IP address and set up routing.

You can find the required network parameters (IP address, CIDR, and MAC address) in the **Networking** tab of your Virtual Machine settings:

<Frame>
  ![Network interface details in VM settings](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/vm-interface-details.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
  **Info**

  The gateway IP address is typically the first usable IP in the subnet's CIDR range. For example, if the CIDR is `10.10.0.0/24`, the gateway is `10.10.0.1`.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    1\. Connect to your Virtual Machine via SSH or console.

    2\. List available network interfaces to find the new one:

    ```sh
    ip link show
    ```

    The new interface will appear in the list (for example, `eth1`, `ens4`, or similar). You can identify it by the MAC address shown in the portal.

    3\. Bring up the interface:

    ```sh
    sudo ip link set <interface_name> up
    ```

    4\. Assign the IP address with the subnet mask:

    ```sh
    sudo ip addr add <ip_address>/<prefix> dev <interface_name>
    ```

    For example, to assign `10.10.0.134` with a `/24` prefix to the `eth1` interface:

    ```sh
    sudo ip addr add 10.10.0.134/24 dev eth1
    ```

    5\. (Optional) Add a route to the private network via the gateway:

    ```sh
    sudo ip route add <network_cidr> via <gateway_ip> dev <interface_name>
    ```

    For example:

    ```sh
    sudo ip route add 10.10.0.0/24 via 10.10.0.1 dev eth1
    ```

    6\. Verify the configuration:

    ```sh
    ip addr show <interface_name>
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Warning**

      These commands configure the interface temporarily. After a reboot, the settings will be lost. To make the configuration persistent, add it to your system's network configuration files (such as Netplan for Ubuntu or `ifcfg` files for CentOS/RHEL).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1\. Connect to your Virtual Machine via RDP or console.

    2\. Open **Control Panel** and go to **Network and Sharing Center**.

    3\. Click **Change adapter settings** in the left panel.

    4\. Right-click the new network adapter and select **Properties**.

    5\. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.

    6\. Select **Use the following IP address** and enter:
       - **IP address**: The reserved IP assigned to the interface (for example, `10.10.0.134`)
       - **Subnet mask**: Based on the CIDR prefix (for `/24`, use `255.255.255.0`)
       - **Default gateway**: The first IP in the subnet (for example, `10.10.0.1`)

    7\. Click **OK** to save the settings.

    To verify the configuration, open Command Prompt and run:

    ```sh
    ipconfig
    ```

    The new interface should display the assigned IP address.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For more detailed information about configuring network interfaces, refer to the [Virtual IP (VIP) address configuration](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-virtual-ip-vip-address#configure-a-virtual-ip-address-for-non-windows-virtual-machines) guide.

## Detach a reserved IP from a VM

Detach the subnetwork to which the reserved IP is assigned. This address will be detached from the Virtual Machine automatically.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Assign a reserved IP to a load balancer

You can assign the reserved IP only during the Load Balancer creation.

For instructions on how to add a Reserved IP when creating a Load Balancer, refer to the [Load Balancer creation](/cloud/networking/create-and-configure-a-load-balancer#step-4-configure-network) guide.

## Find a resource with reserved IP

If a reserved IP address is attached to a particular resource, you'll see this information on the **Reserved IPs** page, in the **Status** column:

<Frame>
  ![Reserved IPs page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/attached-to-instance.png)
</Frame>

Click the resource name to view and update its settings.

## Delete a reserved IP

If the reserved IP is attached to the Virtual Machine or Load Balancer, you need to detach it first. Otherwise, you won't be able to delete the IP.

To delete a reserved IP address:

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **Cloud** \> **Networking**.

<Frame>
  ![Networks page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/networks-page.png)
</Frame>

2. Open the **Reserved IPs** page.
3. Click a three-dot icon next to the IP you want to delete.
4. Select **Delete**.
