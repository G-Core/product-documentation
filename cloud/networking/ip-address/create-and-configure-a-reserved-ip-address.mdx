A reserved IP is a dedicated address that can be assigned to a [Virtual Machine](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance), [Bare Metal server](/cloud/bare-metal-servers/create-a-bare-metal-server), or [Load Balancer](/cloud/networking/create-and-configure-a-load-balancer). It exists independently of resources, can be pre-configured in DNS or firewall rules, and remains valid when reassigned. A reserved IP can also be used as a [virtual IP address](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-virtual-ip-vip-address).

## How it works

After a reserved IP is created, this address is exclusively allocated within the Gcore system. No other account can use it. The IP can be assigned to a resource or kept unassigned for future use.

## How it is charged

The monthly price for the IP is displayed in the order window. Billing applies only for the time from creating an IP to deleting it.

If an IP is reserved and deleted after an hour, charges apply only for that hour. The price remains the same whether the IP is assigned or not.

## Reserve an IP address

To create a new reserved IP:

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **Cloud** \> **Networking**.

<Frame>
  ![Networks page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/networks-page.png)
</Frame>

2. Open the **Reserved IPs** page.

<Info>
  A project can have up to 1000 reserved fixed IP addresses that are not attached to any resource.
</Info>

3. Click **Reserve new IP**.

<Frame>
  ![Reserved IPs page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/reserved-ips-page.png)
</Frame>

4. Select the network type:

- **Public** (for external network). A public IP address can be created immediately.
- **Private** (for internal network). For this option, select the network and subnetwork in which the address will be created.
- **Dedicated public** (for dedicated public network). Select this option if a dedicated public network is configured for the project.

<Info>
  A reserved private IP can only be used in the specified subnetwork. To request a specific address, select **Custom** in the **IP address to reserve** section and enter the IP that belongs to that subnetwork.
</Info>

5. (Optional) In the **IP Family** section, select the IP version: **IPv4**, **IPv6**, or **Dual (IPv4 + IPv6)**.

6. Click **Reserve IP**.

## Assign a reserved IP to a VM

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="During VM creation">
    Refer to the [VM creation](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance#step-5-add-network-interfaces) guide.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After VM creation">
    1. In the Virtual Machine settings, open the **Networking** tab.

    If the machine is already connected to the target subnetwork, detach it first before assigning a new IP. This will remove the old IP.

      ![Detach subnetwork](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/detach-subnetwork.png)
    </Frame>
    2. Add a new interface (public or private) and enable the **Use reserved IP** toggle.

    </Frame>
    3. Select the reserved IP and click **Add**.

    The IP will be assigned to the Virtual Machine.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure the network interface in the operating system

Manual configuration is required only when adding a private interface to an existing VM or Bare Metal server. Find the IP address, CIDR, and MAC in the **Networking** tab. The gateway is the first usable IP in the subnet (`10.10.0.1` for `10.10.0.0/24`).

<Frame>
  ![Network interface details in VM settings](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/vm-interface-details.png)
</Frame>

<Warning>
  These commands configure the interface temporarily. To make the configuration persistent, add it to the system's network configuration files (Netplan for Ubuntu, `ifcfg` for CentOS/RHEL, or Windows network adapter settings).
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    1\. Connect to the Virtual Machine via SSH or console.

    2\. List available network interfaces to find the new one:

    ```sh
    ip link show
    ```

    The new interface (`eth1`, `ens4`, or similar) can be identified by the MAC address shown in the portal.

    3\. Bring up the interface:

    ```sh
    sudo ip link set <interface_name> up
    ```

    4\. Assign the IP address with the subnet mask:

    ```sh
    sudo ip addr add <ip_address>/<prefix> dev <interface_name>
    ```

    5\. (Optional) Add a route to the private network via the gateway:

    ```sh
    sudo ip route add <network_cidr> via <gateway_ip> dev <interface_name>
    ```

    6\. Verify the configuration:

    ```sh
    ip addr show <interface_name>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1\. Connect to the Virtual Machine via RDP or console.

    2\. Open **Control Panel** > **Network and Sharing Center** > **Change adapter settings**.

    3\. Right-click the new network adapter and select **Properties**.

    4\. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.

    5\. Select **Use the following IP address** and enter the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

    6\. Click **OK** to save the settings.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For more detailed information, refer to the [Virtual IP (VIP) address configuration](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-virtual-ip-vip-address#configure-a-virtual-ip-address-for-non-windows-virtual-machines) guide.

## Detach a reserved IP from a VM

Detaching is required before reassigning the IP to another resource or deleting it.

1. Open the Virtual Machine settings.
2. Go to the **Networking** tab.
3. Expand the interface that contains the reserved IP.
4. Click the three-dot menu next to the subnetwork row.
5. Select **Detach Subnetwork**.

## Assign a reserved IP to a load balancer

A reserved IP can only be assigned during Load Balancer creation. The IP becomes the frontend address and is tightly bound to the frontend network interface, so it cannot be changed after provisioning.

For instructions, refer to the [Load Balancer creation](/cloud/networking/create-and-configure-a-load-balancer#step-4-configure-network) guide.

## Find a resource with reserved IP

The **Status** column on the **Reserved IPs** page shows if an IP is attached to a resource:

<Frame>
  ![Reserved IPs page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/attached-to-instance.png)
</Frame>

Click the resource name to view and update its settings.

## Delete a reserved IP

If the reserved IP is attached to a resource, detach it first.

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **Cloud** \> **Networking**.

<Frame>
  ![Networks page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-reserved-ip-address/networks-page.png)
</Frame>

2. Open the **Reserved IPs** page.
3. Click the three-dot icon next to the target IP.
4. Select **Delete**.
