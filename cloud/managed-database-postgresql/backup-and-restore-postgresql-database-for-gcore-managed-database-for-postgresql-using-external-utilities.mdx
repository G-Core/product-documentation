sidebarTitle: Backup and restore
---

This guide will explain how to backup and restore PostgreSQL databases with the `pg_dump` (`pg_dumpall`) and `pg_restore` tools.

To protect yourself against data loss, we recommend frequently backing up the databases you manage with [Gcore Managed PostgreSQL](/cloud/managed-database-postgresql).

## 1\. Install external utilities

Install backup and restore utilities on your virtual or local server. Below are guides on how to do so for Ubuntu, CentOS, and Windows.

**Note** : You must have root rights to run the commands successfully. 


<Accordion title="Ubuntu 22.04">
1. Access your Virtual Server.

2. Download the latest available updates and upgrade `apt`:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```


3. To install ` pg_dump` and `pg_restore` tools, install the Postgres package, which includes them:
  
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CentOS 7">
1. Access your Virtual Server.

2. Install the PostgreSQL package:

  ```sh
  $ sudo yum install postgresql-server
  ```


The package contains all required tools.
</Accordion>
 
<Accordion title="Windows">
1. Download the [installer of the relevant PostgreSQL version](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).

2. Run the installation process.

## 2\. Get your credentials

To launch backup and restore tools, you need credentials (`username`, `password`, `port`, and `dbname`) to connect to the Gcore Managed Database server, where databases are stored. You can find credentials in the Customer Portal, with instructions available in [our dedicated guide](/cloud/managed-database-postgresql/manage-postgresql-servers#get-your-credentials). 

## 3\. Back up databases

### Back up a specific database

Use one of the following commands depending on your choice of backup format:

  * **Default SQL format** : `$ pg_dump -U username -W -h hostname -d database_name > database_name.sql`
  * **TAR format** : `$ pg_dump -F t -U username -W -h hostname -d database_name > backup_file.tar`
  * **Custom format** : `$ pg_dump -F c -U username -W -h hostname -d database_name > backup_file.dump`
  * **Directory format** : `$ pg_dump -F d -U username -W -h hostname -d database_name -f backup_dir`



Instead of `username`, `hostname`, and `database_name`, enter custom values, which you can access [using our guide](/cloud/managed-database-postgresql/manage-postgresql-servers#get-your-credentials). For `backup_file` or `backup_dir`, specify the relevant name for the backup file or directory.

Below are some other details for the commands:

  * `-W` prompts the password before connecting to the PostgreSQL server
  * `-F` specifies the output format of the backup and can be followed by the following flags:
    * `c` for custom format
    * `d` for directory format
    * `t` for tar



### Back up all databases

Run the command:

```sh
$ pg_dumpall -U username -W -h hostname > all_pg.sql
 ```

Where: 

  * `all_pg.sql` is the output backup name
  * `username` is your username from the Customer Portal
  * `hostname` is your hostname from the Customer Portal



## 4\. Restore databases

Run the command: 

```sh
$ pg_restore -U username -W -h hostname -d database_name < backup_file.tar
 ```

Where: 

  * `username` is your username from the Customer Portal
  * `hostname` is your hostname from the Customer Portal 
  * `database_name` is your database name from the Customer Portal
  * `backup_file.tar` is the file or directory with your backup
