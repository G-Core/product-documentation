We offer various types of Bare Metal servers optimized for specific use cases and workload demands: 

  * **High-frequency** : Optimized for high processing speeds with single-core performance. Ideal for workloads requiring fast, high-frequency computing power, such as real-time analytics, low-latency applications or gaming servers. 

  * **Infrastructure** : Multi-core servers with multiple CPU sockets designed to handle applications demanding a high number of cores. Perfect for enterprise workloads, large databases, and virtualized environments. 

  * **Basic** : Core servers designed for lightweight applications, development environments, or micro-containers. This is a cost-effective solution for general-purpose workloads.




Check out the following sections for a detailed overview of these Bare Metal server types and the relevant use cases.
