Gcore Managed PostgreSQL is a fully managed cloud solution designed to simplify management of relational databases. We take care of server maintenance and administration tasks, so you can focus on your application and users.

## How does it work?

A core of the Managed PostgreSQL architecture is a PostgreSQL server. Each server is an instance of the PostgreSQL relational database management system. The server hosts the PostgreSQL engine, which processes SQL queries, manages data storage, and handles other database-related tasks. 

Once a PostgreSQL server is configured and provisioned, you can start using it. The server's configuration, including flavor, connection pooler mode, volume type, and more, is tailored to meet the specific needs of your applications and workloads.

Within each server, you can create multiple relational databases. Users and applications can interact with the server to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, while the underlying infrastructure handles server maintenance and management tasks.

## Supported versions

Gcore Managed PostgreSQL currently supports PostgreSQL 13,14 and 15.

## Key features

Gcore Managed PostgreSQL offers the following advantages:

  1. Managed infrastructure: We handle the infrastructure, ensuring your database runs smoothly and securely.
  2. Flexible instance configuration: Customize your database instance by choosing the vCPU/RAM size, storage capacity, and database configuration that best suits your specific load requirements.
  3. High availability: We provide the high availability feature, which allows you to deploy two additional replicas to fail over if the primary server goes down. To increase data consistency, you can select the synchronous replication mode.
  4. Security: You can restrict access to your data to the IP addresses from the access control list. 
  5. Wide geography: Choose from a wide range of data center locations, ensuring low-latency access for users across the globe.



## Use cases

Managed PostgreSQL can be the best fit for different industries and use cases: 

  * Web Applications: Web and mobile app developers can manage databases for their projects more efficiently
  * Analytics: Data analytics and business intelligence applications benefit from scalable and high-performance databases
  * IoT (Internet of Things): Managed PostgreSQL supports the storage and analysis of massive volumes of data generated by IoT devices
  * E-commerce: Online retailers rely on Managed PostgreSQL to handle large product catalogs and customer data



## Billing
