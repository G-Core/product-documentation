  * The date and time when the user was created 

  * (Optional) If the password expiration date was set during user creation, this information will be displayed in the **Expires at** column.

<Tip>
**Tip**

For details on how to create a user, check the [Create a Container Registry](/cloud/container-registry/create-container-registry) guide.
</Tip>

### Change user permissions

For each user, you can configure the following permissions: 

  * **Pull images** : this is helpful if you'd like to prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to the Container Registry. In this case, you can restrict permissions for some users to pull operations only. 

  * **Push and push images** : this permission grants full access to the registry and allows users to pull and push any new images or image versions to the registry.




To change user permissions: 

1\. On the **Users** tab, find the user you want to delete and click the three-dot icon next to it. 

2\. Select **Change permissions**.
