## My device is not connecting to the cellular network

1\. Make sure your device supports eSIM service.

2\. If you have an enterprise or corporate cellular service plan, check with your company or carrier to see if they support eSIM functionality.

3\. Make sure that your carrier provides coverage in your area and that there are no ongoing service outages that could affect your connectivity.

4\. Make sure that your cellular plans are set up, ready to use, and don't have a billing-related blockage.

## Slow internet connection

1\. **Check your location**. Ensure that you are near the cellular network transmitters. Being too far from the transmitters can weaken the signal strength and result in slower internet speeds.

2\. **Monitor network traffic**. Pay attention to the amount of transmitted and received traffic, particularly during peak hours. The speed can be slower when many users in the area are simultaneously accessing the network.

3\. **Close background applications**. Check the number of applications running in the background that may be transferring or downloading data. Close unnecessary apps to free up the bandwidth and speed up the connection.
