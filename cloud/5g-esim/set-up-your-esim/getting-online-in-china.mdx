China has a very particular network organization. Follow these recommendations to maximize the network services in China and prevent blocking.

1\. **Make sure you are using a tablet, a Miâ€“Fi device or a USB modem**. In China, phones are required to be able to make emergency calls. Since we provide only internet connection, without voice or SMS services, the network access may be blocked for your phone.

2\. **Make sure your device supports the LTE bands used in China**. Devices made for the European market may support different LTE bands than those made to work in China.

3\. **Make sure your device operates within LTE range 3 or 41**.
