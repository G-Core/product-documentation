## What are PV and PVC?

A PV (PersistentVolume) in Managed Kubernetes is a resource used to store data. It is attached to pods but has a separate lifecycle, specified by its reclaim policy. This policy determines if a PV will continue to exist or will be deleted when a pod attached to it gets destroyed.

A PV represents a piece of available storage. To use a PV, a user needs to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC,) which is a request for storage. Kubernetes passes this request to a storage class, which creates PVs automatically in response to the PVC.

## Create a PVC

Before you create a PVC, you need to create a storage class with the required disk type. Gcore provides the following disk types:

| Volume type    | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| standard       | Standard Network SSD disk, which provides stable and high random I/O performance, as well as high data reliability (6 IOPS per 1 GiB; 0.4 MB/s per 1 GiB.) The IOPS performance limit is 4,500. The bandwidth limit is 300 MB/s. |
| ssd_hiiops     | High IOPS SSD High-performance SSD block storage designed for latency-sensitive transactional workloads (60 IOPS per 1 GiB; 2.5 MB/s per 1 GiB.) The IOPS performance limit is 9,000. The bandwidth limit is 500 MB/s.           |
| ssd_lowlatency | SSD Low Latency SSD block storage, designed for applications that require low-latency storage and real-time data processing. It can achieve IOPS performance of up to 5000, with an average latency of 300 Âµs.                   |

To proceed with a PVC, follow the steps:

1. Make sure the required disk type is available in your region. To do so, go to the **Kubernetes** tab, select the required region and click **Create new cluster**. Click the **Volume type** field and check which options are available on the drop-down list.

</Frame>

If you create a storage class with a volume type that is not available in your region, the PV won't work.

2. Create a YAML file to create a storage class with the required disk type:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1  
kind: StorageClass  
metadata:  
  name: csi-sc-cinderplugin-hiiops  
  annotations:  
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "false"  
provisioner: cinder.csi.gcorelabs.com  
parameters:  
  type: ssd_hiiops  
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

Enter your custom values instead:

- `csi-sc-cinderplugin-hiiops`: Storage class name
- `ssd_hiiops`: Disk type (`standard`, `ssd_hiiops`, or `ssd_lowlatency`)

2. Run the kubectl command from the file directory:

```sh
kubectl apply -f <name of the created YAML file>.yaml
```

You will get this output:

```sh
storageclass/<the name of the created storage class> created
```

3. Create a YAML file to configure a PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  
metadata:  
  name: block-pvc  
spec:  
  storageClassName: csi-sc-cinderplugin-hiiops  
  accessModes:  
    - ReadWriteOnce  
  resources:  
    requests:  
      storage: 1Gi
```

Enter your custom values instead:

- `block-pvc`: PVC name
- `csi-sc-cinderplugin-hiiops`: Name of the created storage class
- `1Gi`: Storage size

4. Run the kubectl command from the file directory:

```sh
kubectl apply -f <name of the created YAML file>.yaml
```

You will get this output:

```sh
persistentvolumeclaim/<the name of the created PVC> created
```

This means you have successfully created a PVC with a storage class of the required disk type. To connect the PVC to your pods, refer to the section below.

## Bind your PVC to a pod

1. Create a YAML file to bind the created storage class to your pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: mypod
spec:  
  containers:  
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx  
      volumeMounts:  
        - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
          name: mypd
  volumes:  
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:  
        claimName: block-pvc
```

Enter your custom values instead:

- `mypod`: Pod name
- `myfrontend`: Container name
- `"/var/www/html"`: Destination inside the pod where to mount the storage class
- `mypd`: Storage class name
- `block-pvc`: Created PVC name

2. Run the kubectl command from the file directory:

```sh
kubectl apply -f <name of the created YAML file>.yaml
```

3. You will get this output:

```sh
pod/<the pod name> created
```

This means you have successfully connected the PVC to your pod, and its containers can now access the storage.

## Resize a PVC

Gcore Managed Kubernetes offers you predefined storage classes for PVs. If you issue a PVC, Managed Kubernetes will provision a dynamic PV that matches the PVC's specs. This means that to increase the size of a PV, you have to update the PVC that was used to create it.

<Info>Reducing the size of a PV is not supported</Info>

1\. Find the PVC by querying all PVCs with this command:

```
kubectl get pvc
```

2\. Locate the storage field in your PVC spec and replace it with your desired size (e.g., 1 Ti, 250 Gi, etc.).

An example PVC spec for 250 GB and the standard storage class could look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 250Gi
```

3\. Send it to your cluster with this command:

```
kubectl apply -f /path/to/example-pvc.yaml
```

The update may take a few minutes to complete.

4\. Check if the resize worked.

```
kubectl get pvc example-pvc
```
