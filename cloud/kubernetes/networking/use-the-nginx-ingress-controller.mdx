To start using the controller, you need to apply an Ingress manifest.

1\. Create a YAML file to create an Ingress object:

```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: foo
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: www.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: exampleService
                port:
                  number: 80
            path: /
 ```

Enter your custom values instead:

  * hello-world-ingress: Name of the Ingress object
  * nginx: Name of ingressClassResource
  * /: Default URL path 
  * hello-world-svc: Name of the Service that will manage the requests 
  * 80: Port of the Service that will manage the requests



2\. Run the kubectl command.

```sh
kubectl apply -f <name of the created YAML-file>
 ```

You'll get the output:

```sh
Ingress/<name of the created ingress object> created
 ```

This means you've successfully created and applied an Ingress object for the nginx Ingress Controller.
