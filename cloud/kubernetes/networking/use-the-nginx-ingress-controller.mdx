To start using the controller, you need to apply an Ingress manifest.

1\. Create a YAML file to create an Ingress object:

```yml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1  
kind: Ingress  
metadata:  
  name: hello-world-ingress  
spec:  
  ingressClassName: nginx  
   rules:  
   - http:  
      paths:  
      - path: /  
        backend:  
          serviceName: hello-world-svc  
          servicePort: 80
 ```

Enter your custom values instead:

  * hello-world-ingress: Name of the Ingress object
  * nginx: Name of ingressClassResource
  * /: Default URL path 
  * hello-world-svc: Name of the Service that will manage the requests 
  * 80: Port of the Service that will manage the requests



2\. Run the kubectl command.

```sh
kubectl apply -f <name of the created YAML-file>
 ```

You'll get the output:

```sh
Ingress/<name of the created ingress object> created
 ```

This means you've successfully created and applied an Ingress object for the nginx Ingress Controller.
