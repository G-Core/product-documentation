Configure centralized and secure access management for your Kubernetes cluster by configuring [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) authentication. 

Integrating Kubernetes with an OIDC provider is a quick way to set up a single sign-on (SSO) experience for your users. This way, they can access multiple Kubernetes clusters without re-entering their credentials. 

OIDC relies on industry-standard security mechanisms, which also ensures enhanced security of your cluster and mitigates the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. 

## Enable OIDC authentication for Managed Kubernetes

You can enable authentication [during cluster creation](/cloud/kubernetes/clusters/create-a-kubernetes-cluster) or in the settings of an existing cluster. Regardless of where you start, the configuration process remains the same. 

To enable OIDC authentication for your cluster: 

1\. If you're creating a new cluster, scroll down to the **OIDC authentication** section. If you want to enable authentication for an existing cluster, open the cluster overview and click the **Advanced settings** tab. 

2\. Click **Enable OIDC authentication** toggle and configure the following settings: 

  * **Issuer URL** : Enter the URL of the OIDC provider. For example, https://login.microsoftonline.com. 

  * **Client ID** : Enter a unique identifier that will be assigned for the cluster.

  * **Groups claim** (optional): Specify the name of the claim in ID token that stores a group name. If you don't add user groups, each user will be treated independently. 

  * **Set required claims** toggle: Enter any additional claims that must be present in the ID token. If a token is missing any of these claims, a user will not be authenticated. 

  * **Signing algorithms** : Choose which cryptographic algorithms the API server should accept when verifying ID tokens. By default, tokens are required to be signed using the RS256 algorithm. 

  * **Username claim** : Specify the name of the claim in ID token that contains a username.

3\. Save the changes if necessary. 

You've successfully set up the OIDC authentication for your cluster. 

## Disable OIDC authentication for Kubernetes

<Warning>
**Warning**

Disabling OIDC authentication in your cluster settings will remove your current configuration. If you enable the authentication later, you'll need to configure all the settings again.
</Warning>

To disable OIDC authentication: 

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **Cloud** > **Managed Kubernetes**. 

2\. Find the cluster for which you want to configure OIDC and click its name to open it. 

3\. Open the **Advanced settings** tab. 

4\. Click to expand the **OIDC authentication** section. 

5\. Disable the toggle.

6\. Click **Save changes**. 

You no longer have the OIDC authentication configured for your Kubernetes cluster.

## Update OIDC authentication settings

<Info>
**Info**

If you want to reset any previous configuration, click **Restore Default**. Be cautious when using this option because it will undo any OIDC configurations you've set up.
</Info>

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **Cloud** > **Managed Kubernetes**. 

2\. Find the cluster for which you want to update OIDC and click its name to open it. 

3\. Open the **Advanced settings** tab. 

4\. Click to expand the **OIDC authentication** section. 

5\. Adjust the settings as needed. 

6\. Click **Save changes**. 

You've successfully updated the OIDC settings.
