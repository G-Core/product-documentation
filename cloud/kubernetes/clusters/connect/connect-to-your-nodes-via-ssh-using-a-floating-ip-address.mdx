You can connect to your nodes via [a floating IP address](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-floating-ip-address).

## Assign a floating IP address

1\. In the Cloud menu, go to **Kubernetes**, find the required cluster and click its name.

2\. Go to the **Pools** section, click the required pool to expand the menu, find the node you want to connect to and click **Add IP**.

3\. In the new window, create a new floating IP address or attach an existing one.

  * To create a new floating IP address, go to the **Assign a floating IP** section, switch on the **Assign to existing instance** toggle, choose the node and interface, and click **Create a new floating IP**.

  * To assign an existing floating IP address, find the required one in the list below the **Assign a floating IP** section and click **Assign to instance**.

In the new window, choose the node and the interface and click **Assign floating IP**.

The floating IP has been assigned to the node, and you can now access it.

## Connect to your node via SSH

Run the command in the command line utility:

```sh
ssh core@[floating IP address] -i "[path to the private SSH key]"
 ```

Replace **[floating IP address]** with the actual floating IP address of the node and **[path to the private SSH key**] with the path to the private key on your local machine.
