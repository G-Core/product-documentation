Gcore offers storage solutions compatible with [S3](/storage) and [NFS](/cloud/file-shares/about-file-shares).

This guide explains how to migrate data from Amazon S3 or EFS to Gcore using [rclone](https://rclone.org/), a popular CLI tool for cloud storage management.

<Info>
  **AWS bills outgoing traffic**. Before migrating a large amount of data, [check the transfer costs.](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/DataTransfer)
</Info>

The following sections use similar AWS and Gcore credentials and rclone configuration patterns. Once configured, the same remotes work across multiple migration scenarios.

## Migrate data from S3 to Gcore

### Gcore Object Storage

To keep processes close to the existing AWS infrastructure, [Gcore Object Storage](/storage) is a good choice for migration.

**Prerequisites:** A Linux machine with public Internet access and rclone installed.

#### Step 1. Collect AWS account credentials

Use an existing AWS CLI user or create a new one via IAM. The user must have read access to the source bucket.

Required AWS credentials and bucket details:

- Access key ID
- Secret access key
- Source bucket region
- Source bucket name

#### Step 2. Create a Gcore Object Storage bucket

Create a new Object Storage bucket as described in [Create S3 or SFTP storage.](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage) At the end of this process, the following Gcore credentials and bucket details are available:

- Access key ID
- Secret access key
- Endpoint
- Bucket name

#### Step 3. Configure rclone remotes

Add rclone remotes for AWS and Gcore to the rclone config file:

```sh
~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

Paste the following configuration, replacing placeholders with the values from the previous steps:

```ini
[aws-s3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
access_key_id = <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_access_key = <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
region = <AWS_REGION>
acl = private

[gcore-os]
type = s3
provider = Other
access_key_id = <GCORE_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_access_key = <GCORE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
endpoint = <GCORE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT>
acl = private
```

#### Step 4. Migrate the data

Sync the data from S3 to Gcore Object Storage:

```sh
rclone sync aws-s3://<SOURCE_BUCKET> gcore-os://<DESTINATION_BUCKET>
```

Replace `SOURCE_BUCKET` with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket and `DESTINATION_BUCKET` with the name of the Gcore Object Storage bucket.

### Gcore File Share (NFS)

To use data from S3 via NFS mounts inside an instance or container, consider [Gcore File Shares.](/cloud/file-shares/about-file-shares)

Complete these steps on a Gcore instance with public Internet access, Linux, and rclone installed.

#### Step 1. Collect AWS account credentials

Gather the same AWS credentials and bucket details as described in the Object Storage migration above.

#### Step 2. Create and mount a Gcore File Share

Create a new File Share as described in [Configure File Shares.](/cloud/file-shares/configure-file-shares) At the end of this process, the mount path of the File Share is available.

#### Step 3. Configure rclone remote

Add the `[aws-s3]` remote to `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` using the same configuration pattern as in the Object Storage migration.

#### Step 4. Migrate the data

Sync the data from S3 directly to the mounted File Share:

```sh
rclone sync aws-s3://<SOURCE_BUCKET> <DESTINATION_PATH>
```

Replace `SOURCE_BUCKET` with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket and `DESTINATION_PATH` with the Gcore File Share mount path from Step 2.

## Migrate data from EFS to Gcore

### Gcore Object Storage

Migrate data from Amazon EFS to Gcore Object Storage for backup.

**Prerequisites:** An EC2 instance with access to the EFS, public Internet access, Linux, and [rclone](https://rclone.org/install/) installed.

#### Step 1. Create a Gcore Object Storage bucket

Create a new Object Storage bucket as described in [Create S3 or SFTP storage.](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage) The same Gcore credentials listed in the S3 migration section are needed: access key ID, secret access key, endpoint, and bucket name.

#### Step 2. Configure rclone remote

Add the rclone remote for Gcore to the rclone config file:

```sh
~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
```

Paste the following configuration, replacing placeholders with the credentials from Step 1:

```ini
[gcore-os]
type = s3
provider = Other
access_key_id = <GCORE_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_access_key = <GCORE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
endpoint = <GCORE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT>
acl = private
```

#### Step 3. Migrate the data

Sync the EFS data to Gcore Object Storage:

```sh
rclone sync <SOURCE_PATH> gcore-os://<DESTINATION_BUCKET>
```

Replace `SOURCE_PATH` with the Amazon EFS mount path and `DESTINATION_BUCKET` with the Gcore Object Storage bucket name from Step 1.

### Gcore File Share (NFS)

Gcore File Shares and Amazon EFS are private to their respective cloud infrastructures.

<Info>
Direct migration between Amazon EFS and Gcore File Shares isn't possible. First, migrate data to Gcore Object Storage using the steps in the previous section, then transfer it to a File Share.
</Info>

Before starting, ensure a Gcore instance with public Internet access, Linux, and rclone is available.

#### Step 1. Create and mount a Gcore File Share

Create a new File Share as described in [Configure File Shares.](/cloud/file-shares/configure-file-shares) Note the mount path for use in Step 3.

#### Step 2. Configure rclone

If not already configured, add the `[gcore-os]` remote to `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` using the same configuration from the Object Storage migration above.

#### Step 3. Migrate the data

Pull the data from Object Storage to the mounted File Share:

```sh
rclone sync gcore-os://<SOURCE_BUCKET> <DESTINATION_PATH>
```

Replace `SOURCE_BUCKET` with the name of the Gcore Object Storage bucket and `DESTINATION_PATH` with the Gcore File Share mount path from Step 1.
