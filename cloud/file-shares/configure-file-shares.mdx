You can create NFS-based file shares and mount them to your Linux virtual machines, bare metal servers, or GPU clusters.

There are two available types:

- **Standard** is a general-purpose file share using a Ceph-based backend.
- **VAST** is a high-performance file share type that is available in selected GPU-enabled regions.

<Info>
  File share types are **mutually exclusive**, meaning each region has either Standard **or** VAST file shares, never both.
</Info>

The creation flow for both types starts the same. Use the steps below and follow the instructions for your selected file share type.

<Info>
  Before configuring, you should have enough quotas to create a file share. To increase quotas, send us a request according to our guide. The quotas for File Shares are located on the Storage tab and include File Share count and File Share size (GiB).

## Prepare your network for Bare Metal

If you plan to mount the file share on a bare-metal server, the network must support bare-metal, and these servers require a dedicated VLAN.

If needed, create a new network and enable the **Bare Metal Network** toggle during configuration.

<Info>
  You must manually change the OS settings' existing Bare Metal network interface.

## Configure file shares for Linux VMs and Bare Metal

This section describes creating and connecting a standard NFS-based file share using a private network. It can be used with Linux virtual machines or bare-metal servers.

### Step 1: Create a file share

1. In the **Cloud** menu, go to the **Storage** tab, select **File Shares**, and click **Create File Share**.

</Frame>

2. A new page will open. In **Basic settings**, enter the name of the file share, specify its size, and select **Standard** as the type.

![File Shares Standard 4 Pn](/images/file-shares-standard-4.png)

3. In the **File Share network settings**, select the private network and subnetwork you will use for file sharing.
4. In **Access**, click **Add rule** and specify the IP addresses of the machines that should have access to the file share and their access modes.
5. (Optional) Add tags.

### Step 2: Connect to your server

Connect to your server via the **Gcore Customer Portal** or SSH and install the NFS client to enable your system to access the file share.

For Ubuntu and Debian:

`sudo apt -y install nfs-common`

For CentOS:

`sudo yum install nfs-utils`

### Step 3: Mount the file share

1. Choose or create a file directory to mount the shared files.
2. Go to the required file share **Overview** tab and copy the mount command from the **File Share mount** section.

</Frame>

Run the command:

`mount 0.0.0.0:/shares/share-d54589b8-132f-4de4-ae99-af5c6cdfdb9c /mount/path`

Replace `/mount/path` with the path to the local file directory where you want to mount the file share.

## VAST file shares

<Info>
  The VAST-based file share type is available only in regions with GPU support. It uses a high-performance backend designed for intensive data workloads.
</Info>

### Step 1: Create a file share

1. In the **Cloud** menu, go to the **Storage** tab, select **File Share**s, and click **Create File Share**. A new page will open.
2. In **Basic** settings, enter the name of the file share, specify its size
3. Select **VAST** as the type.
4. (optional) Add tags.

When selecting VAST as the file share type, the interface disables the **Network and Access** settings.

The network is assigned automatically, and you cannot configure access rules manually â€” the VAST share is always available in read/write mode within its assigned network only. This network is not visible in the general **Network** tab. It is only available when attaching interfaces to a resource (VM, Bare Metal, or GPU Cluster).

VAST file shares always use read/write access. Access rules are not supported.

### Step 2: Attach the VAST interface to your server

You can attach the VAST interface during or after the creation of your compute resource.

Once the file share is created:

1. Go to the **resource **settings (VM, Bare Metal, or GPU Cluster).
2. Open the **Interfaces** section.
3. Click **Add interface**.
4. In the **Network** dropdown, select the **VAST network**.
5. Click **Apply**.

The VAST network becomes available only after the file share is created. It is a third, dedicated network, separate from the public and private networks.

### Step 3: Mount the file share

Create or choose a directory where you want to mount the file share.

Run the mount command provided by the customer support or your file share overview. 

For example:

`sudo mount -o vers=3,nconnect=56,remoteports=dns,spread_reads,spread_writes ndp1-2-vast.cloud.gc.onl:/manila/manila-55d09002-a19b-465c-ba19-280024637cfb /mount/path`

Now you can access the contents of the VAST file share in the specified directory.

<Info>
  Always use NFS version 3 (vers=3) when mounting VAST file shares. If your system does not support the `nconnect` option, install the[ VAST Enhanced NFS Client](https://vastnfs.vastdata.com/docs/4.0/download.html).
</Info>

## Change size and unmount a file share

If you want to change the file share size, you must unmount it and then remount it.

To unmount a file share:

`umount -lf /your/share`

To resize your file share, go to the **Overview** tab and click **Resize** as shown below.

This process is the same for both Standard and VAST-based file shares.
