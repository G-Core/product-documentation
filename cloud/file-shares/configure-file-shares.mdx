You can create NFS-based file shares and mount them to your Linux virtual machines, bare metal servers, or GPU clusters.

There are two available types:

- **Standard** is a general-purpose file share using a Ceph-based backend.
- **VAST** is a high-performance file share type that is available in selected GPU-enabled regions.

<Info>
  File share types are **mutually exclusive**, meaning each region has either Standard **or** VAST file shares, never both.
</Info>

<Info>
  It is best to create VAST shares either **during** the creation of [GPU clusters](/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/create-an-ai-cluster) or **prior** to provisioning the corresponding [compute resources](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines) (such as VMs).
</Info>

The creation flow for both types starts the same. Use the steps below and follow the instructions for your selected file share type.

<Info>
  Before configuring, you should have enough quotas to create a file share. To increase quotas, send us a request according to our guide. The quotas for File Shares are located on the Storage tab and include File Share count and File Share size (GiB).

## Prepare your network for Bare Metal

If you plan to mount the file share on a bare-metal server, the network must support bare-metal, and these servers require a dedicated VLAN.

If needed, create a new network and enable the **Bare Metal Network** toggle during configuration.

<Info>
  You must manually change the OS settings' existing Bare Metal network interface.

## Configure file shares for Linux VMs and Bare Metal

This section describes creating and connecting a standard NFS-based file share using a private network. It can be used with Linux virtual machines or bare-metal servers.

### Step 1: Create a file share

1. In the **Cloud** menu, go to the **Storage** tab, select **File Shares**, and click **Create File Share**.

<Frame>
  ![File Shares](/images/docs/cloud/file-shares/3-1.png)
</Frame>

2. A new page will open. In **Basic settings**, enter the name of the file share, specify its size, and select **Standard** as the type.

![File Shares Standard 4 Pn](/images/file-shares-standard-4.png)

3. In the **File Share network settings**, select the private network and subnetwork you will use for file sharing.
4. In **Access**, click **Add rule** and specify the IP addresses of the machines that should have access to the file share and their access modes.
5. (Optional) Add tags.

### Step 2: Connect to your server

Connect to your server via the **Gcore Customer Portal** or SSH and install the NFS client to enable your system to access the file share.

For Ubuntu and Debian:

`sudo apt -y install nfs-common`

For CentOS:

`sudo yum install nfs-utils`

### Step 3: Mount the file share

1. Choose or create a file directory to mount the shared files.
2. Go to the required file share **Overview** tab and copy the mount command from the **File Share mount** section.

<Frame>
  ![Mount the file share](/images/docs/cloud/file-shares/4-1.jpg)
</Frame>

Run the command:

`mount 0.0.0.0:/shares/share-d54589b8-132f-4de4-ae99-af5c6cdfdb9c /mount/path`

Replace `/mount/path` with the path to the local file directory where you want to mount the file share.

## VAST file shares

<Info>
  The VAST-based file share type is available only in regions with GPU support. It uses a high-performance backend designed for intensive data workloads.
</Info>

<Info>
  It is best to create VAST shares either **during** the creation of [GPU clusters](/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/create-an-ai-cluster) or **prior** to provisioning the corresponding [compute resources](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines) (such as VMs).
</Info>

### Step 1: Create a VAST share

1. In the **Cloud** menu, go to the **Storage** tab, select **File Share**s, and click **Create File Share**. A new page will open.
2. In **Basic** settings, enter the name of the file share, specify its size.
3. Select **VAST** as the type.
4. (optional) Add tags.

![File Share Vast Pn](/images/file-share-vast.png)

When selecting VAST as the file share type, the interface disables the **Network and Access** settings.

The network is assigned automatically, and you cannot configure access rules manually â€” the VAST share is always available in read/write mode within its assigned network only. This network is not visible in the general **Network** tab. It is only available when attaching interfaces to a resource (VM, Bare Metal, or GPU cluster).

VAST file shares always use read/write access. Access rules are not supported.

### Step 2: Add VAST network interface to a compute resouce

Once the VAST file share is created, it is best to add the VAST network interface while provisioning the corresponding GPU cluster or compute resource.

#### Adding VAST interface while creating a compute resource

While creating a compute resource:

1. Scroll down to the **Network settings** panel.
2. Click **Add interface**
3. Click the interface to configure, and select the **VAST network**.
4. Continue with provisioning the compute resource.

The VAST network becomes available only after the file share is created. It is a third, dedicated network, separate from the public and private networks.

#### Adding VAST interface to an existing compute resource

While the VAST interface can be attached to an already-provisioned GPU cluster or compute resource, this order is generally **not recommended** due to greater complexity.

1. Go to server **Resource** settings ([VM](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance), [Bare Metal](/cloud/bare-metal-servers/create-a-bare-metal-server), or [GPU cluster](/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/create-an-ai-cluster)).
2. Select the **Networking** tab and click **Add interface**.
4. Click the **Network** drop-down and select the **VAST network**, then click **Add**.
6. Once the interface is added, **note the following details** for use in subsequent steps:
   - **IP** address (such as `198.51.100.25`)
   - **MAC** address (such as `fa:16:3e:12:34:56`)
   - **CIDR** block (such as `192.51.100.0/24`)

### Step 3: Configure attached VAST network interface (only for  already-provisioned?)

Connect to your server via the [Gcore Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-control-panel) or SSH and configure the attached VAST network interface.

#### Ubuntu and Debian

1. Run `ip addr` to  list all available interfaces.
2. Identify the VAST interface using the MAC address from the prevous step.
3. Note the **interface name** (such as `enp8s0` or `enp4s0`) for use in the following steps.
4. For the following commands:
   - Replace `198.51.100.25` with the IP adress from Step 2.
   - Replace `enpXs0` with the interface name from above.

     Configure the interface:

     `sudo ip link set enpXs0 mtu 9000` `sudo ip link set enpXs0 up`

     Set the interface CIDR:

     `sudo ip addr add 198.51.100.25/22 dev enpXs0`
5. Add a static route to the VAST network:
   - Replace `198.51.100.1` with the IP adress from Step 2, modifying the last octet to `1` to obtain the gateway address for the network, and use the same interface name.

     `sudo ip route add 172.19.252.0/22 via 198.51.100.1 dev enpXs0`

### Step 4: Install VAST drivers

Connect to your server via the [Gcore Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-control-panel) or SSH and configure the attached VAST network interface.

#### Ubuntu and Debian

Install required build tools and headers:

`sudo apt install dkms debhelper dh-dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y`

Download and install VAST drivers:

`curl -sSf https://vast-nfs.s3.amazonaws.com/download.sh | bash -s --`

`sudo apt -y install nfs-common`

`sudo apt -y install nfs-common`

For CentOS:

`????????`

9. Install the NFS client to enable your system to access the file share.

For Ubuntu and Debian:

`sudo apt -y install nfs-common`

For CentOS:

`sudo yum install nfs-utils`

### Step 3: Mount the file share

Create or choose a directory where you want to mount the file share.

Run the mount command provided by the customer support or your file share overview.

For example:

`sudo mount -o vers=3,nconnect=56,remoteports=dns,spread_reads,spread_writes ndp1-2-vast.cloud.gc.onl:/manila/manila-55d09002-a19b-465c-ba19-280024637cfb /mount/path`

Now you can access the contents of the VAST file share in the specified directory.

<Info>
  Always use NFS version 3 (vers=3) when mounting VAST file shares. If your system does not support the `nconnect` option, install the[ VAST Enhanced NFS Client](https://vastnfs.vastdata.com/docs/4.0/download.html).
</Info>

## Change size and unmount a file share

If you want to change the file share size, you must unmount it and then remount it.

To unmount a file share:

`umount -lf /your/share`

To resize your file share, go to the **Overview** tab and click **Resize** as shown below.

This process is the same for both Standard and VAST-based file shares.
