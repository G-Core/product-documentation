You can find Virtual Machine (VM) statuses inside a project on the **Virtual Instances** page. Check the **Status** column:


<Frame>![VM status column with the Power on status displayed](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/check-the-operational-status-of-your-instance/vm-status-column.png)</Frame>



Each Virtual Machine can have the following statuses: 

  * **Building** : After creation, the Virtual Machine will have the **Building** status for the first few minutes. At this stage, the machine is allocated computing resources. 

  * **Power on** : The Virtual Machine is up and running. The VM status automatically changes to **Power on** once all resources are allocated after its creation.

  * **Power off** : The Virtual Machine is powered off. 

  * **Error** : An error occurred when allocating resources. The machine cannot be allocated. 

  * **Deleted** : Virtual Machine was deleted. If you initiate server deletion, all ongoing operations will be terminated, and the VM will switch to the **Deleted** status.

If an error occurs when allocating resources or your Virtual Machine gets the **Error** status, you can contact [Gcore support](mailto:support@gcore.com) for assistance.
