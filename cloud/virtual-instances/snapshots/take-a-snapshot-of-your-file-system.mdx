**Snapshot** is the state of a system at a particular point in time. The snapshot can be used for backup and further recovery, as well as for deploying new Virtual Machines from **snapshots of system volume.**

**Difference between system and regular volume snapshots**

You can make snapshots for both system (boot) volumes and regular volumes. 

**The system volume** is the volume which the operating system is installed. On this volume, the operating system (OS) stores everything it needs to work. 

**Regular volume** contains all other information for use, except the operating system. 

## Create a snapshot

### From the snapshots page

To make a snapshot of the volume, go to the "Snapshots" section inside the project.

In the "Take snapshot" section, select the volume to create the snapshot. **System volumes** will have the "_bootvolume" Postfix -> Enter a name for the snapshot in the "Name" field and click "Create snapshot".

### From the Virtual Machine

1\. Open the project and go to the **Instances** page and select the Virtual Machine you want to take a snapshot from.

2\. Click the three-dot icon and select **Overview**.

6\. In the "Snapshots" section, you can view a list of created snapshots from VM volumes.

## Snapshot management

A list of all created snapshots can be found in the "Snapshots" section, inside the project.

You can select the necessary option on the selector on the right from the snapshot:

### Delete a snapshot

**Also, you can revert a volume to the latest snapshot**. Open the "Volumes" section, detach the volume from your Virtual Machine and select the reverting option on the selector.

Please note: if you have just resized the volume you will not be able to use the function because the last snapshot is designed for the old size. You can only create a new volume from it. For the new size volume, you need to create a new snapshot.
