Gcore Virtual Machines (VMs) offer a flexible, powerful, and scalable solution for hosting applications and services. Designed to meet a wide range of computing needs, our VMs ensure optimal performance, reliability, and security for your applications.

We provide multiple types of Virtual Machines suitable to different workflows and computing tasks:

  * [Standard](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#standard): Suitable for a wide range of basic workloads that require predictable compute performance.

  * [GPU](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#gpu): Virtual Machines with GPUs process certain types of tasks more efficiently than CPUs and are used for workloads that require the resources of graphics accelerators. These machines have dedicated graphics cards and are ideal for complex computations such as CAD, AI/ML, or rendering.

  * [CPU](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#cpu): Best suited for CPU-intensive tasks that require predictable computing performance, such as batch processing of large data sets and video encoding.

  * [Memory](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#memory): Ideal for tasks and projects that require intensive memory usage, such as databases.

  * [High-frequency](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#high-frequency): Best fit for applications that require single-threaded performance.

  * [Basic VM](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#basic-vm): Machines that work with partial core use and are designed to run applications that don't require high performance. 

  * [VMs with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)](/cloud/virtual-instances/types-of-virtual-machines#tpm): Suitable for a diverse array of secure workloads that demand robust hardware-based security features.


<Info>
**Info**

The network bandwidth capacity for all Virtual Machines, apart from the Basic VM, is up to 1 Gbit/s. For Basic VM, the bandwidth is up to 200Mbit/s.

## TPM

Virtual Machines with a **Trusted Platform Module** (TPM) are suitable for a diverse range of workloads that demand robust hardware-based security features.

**Use cases**

  * **BitLocker Drive Encryption** : Secure entire disks with TPM-protected encryption keys, preventing unauthorized access even if the system is compromised.
  * **Secure boot** : Ensure that the system boots using only software trusted by the manufacturer. TPM provides a secure environment to store cryptographic keys that verify the integrity of the boot process, detecting and preventing unauthorized changes to the boot loader or firmware.
  * **Virtual smart cards** : Provide secure authentication without the need for physical hardware.
  * **Credential Guard** : Isolate and protect user credentials using virtualization-based security (VBS). 
  * **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** : Protect digital content from unauthorized access and distribution with TPM-stored encryption keys.
