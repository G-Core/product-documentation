This guide provides instructions for configuring a pair of SSH keys, adding a public key to the Gcore Customer Portal, and managing the keys within the portal.

## Generate SSH keys

You can generate SSH keys in different ways: 

  * [In the Gcore Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-ssh#generate-ssh-keys-in-the-customer-portal)
  * [Via CLI tools and SSH clients](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-ssh#generate-ssh-keys-via-cli-tools-or-ssh-clients)

<Warning>
**Warning**

Never share your private SSH key or password with third parties. Doing so may result in unauthorized access to your Virtual Machine (VM) and the compromise of any sensitive information stored there.
</Warning>


### Generate SSH keys in the Customer Portal

You can create SSH keys when creating a VM or generate them separately in the ["SSH Keys"](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-ssh#generate-an-ssh-key-in-the-ssh-keys-section) section. 

After you generate the keys, a public key will be added to the system and appear in the "SSH Keys" section, along with any other added or created keys. A private key will be downloaded to your local storage.

<Info>
**Info**

When naming a public key, consider that the name can contain only Latin characters, underscores, spaces, and dots. Its length must be between 3 and 63 characters.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generate an SSH key when creating a VM">
    When [creating a Virtual Machine](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance), in Step 8, you'll be asked to choose one of the following options in the "SSH key" section:

      * **Select SSH key** : Add a key that's already stored in the Gcore Customer Portal by selecting it from the dropdown list.
      * **Add a new SSH key** : Add an existing key generated via CLI tools or SSH client.
      * **Generate an SSH key** : Create a new key.

## Generate SSH keys via CLI tools or SSH clients

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Terminal or Command Prompt">
    Follow these instructions to generate SSH keys on Linux, macOS, or Windows 10/11 devices:

    1\. Open Terminal (Linux, macOS) or Command Prompt (cmd.exe on Windows).

    2\. Run the following command to generate a key pair: 

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
    ```

    You'll be asked to enter the file where the keys should be saved. You can specify a custom location (for example, `.ssh/`), or press **Enter** to save the keys to the default directory. The default directory is `~/.` for Linux/macOS and `C:\Users\\` for Windows.

    4\. Press **Enter**.

    5\. You'll be asked to enter a password for the key as an additional security step. You can either create a password and enter it every time you connect via SSH or leave the field empty and press **Enter** to create the key without a password.

    6\. Confirm the password by entering it again, or leave the field empty and press **Enter**. You can find your key in the default directory or in the custom location you've specified during the key creation.

    7\. The public key will be saved in the .pub file. You need to add this public key to a VM as described in the [Add a public SSH key to the Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-ssh#add-a-public-ssh-key-to-the-customer-portal) section. 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)">
    You can use different distributions of Linux on Windows 11 to generate SSH keys and connect to your VM. To do this, you need to have WSL installed on your device. 

    <Info>
    **Info**

    To install WSL, follow the instructions from the official Microsoft guide: [How to install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
    </Info>

    To generate SSH keys via WSL:

    1\. Open Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.

    2\. Launch a default Linux distribution inside your current command line by running this command: wsl.exe. There are multiple ways to run a Linux distribution, you can read more about them in the following guide: [Ways to run multiple Linux distributions with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#ways-to-run-multiple-linux-distributions-with-wsl).

    3\. Run the following command to generate a key pair:

    ```

    ```

    4\. You'll be asked to enter the file where the keys should be saved. You can specify a custom location (for example, `.ssh/`) or press **Enter** to save the keys to the default directory. The default directory is `C:\Users\\`.

    5\. Press **Enter**.

    6\. You'll be asked to enter a password for the key. You can either create a password or leave the field empty and press **Enter** to create the key without a password.

    7\. Confirm the password by entering it one more time or leave the field empty and press **Enter**. You can find your key in the default directory or in the custom location you've specified during the key creation.

    8\. The public key will be saved in the .pub file. You need to add this public key to a Virtual Machine as described in the [Add a public SSH key to the Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-ssh#add-a-public-ssh-key-to-the-customer-portal) section. 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="PuTTY">
    Follow these instructions to generate SSH keys on Windows 10/11 devices:

    1\. Download and install the [PuTTY package](https://putty.org/).

    2\. Launch the PuTTYgen app.

    3\. Find the "Type of key to generate" parameter and select RSA. 

    4\. In the "Number of bits in a generated key" field, set the value to `2048`.
