You can connect to a Gcore Virtual Machine (VM) by using the [VNC console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) in the Gcore Customer Portal. This method is available for Windows and Linux VMs. The method allows you to establish a connection even if a Virtual Machine has no internet access, which is useful if you experience internet connectivity issues.

Connecting to a Linux Virtual Machine from the Gcore Customer Portal is only possible if you have [configured a password while creating a Virtual Machine](/cloud/virtual-instances/customize-initial-setup-for-your-instance#set-a-password-for-an-instance). If you didn't set a password, you'll need to connect to the VM using SSH keys.

    **Info**

    On Virtual Machines with Windows OS, you can't use the password parameter both in the Access and "User data" fields. Since the Access field is required, configuring user data on a Windows VM is not possible. Read more about the permitted VM parameters in our [API docs](https://api.gcore.com/docs/cloud#tag/Instances/operation/InstanceCreateSetV2.post).
    </Info>

    To connect to a Virtual Machine:

    1\. In the Customer Portal, navigate to **Cloud** > **Virtual Instances**.

    2\. Find the VM you want to access and click its name to open it.

    3\. Next to your VM's IP address, select the **Access to Console** link. The VNC console will open.

    4\. In the top-right corner of the screen, click **SendCtrlAltDel**. 

    5\. Enter the password you configured during VM creation. The login for all VMs is "Admin".

        If you [didn't set a password](/cloud/virtual-instances/customize-initial-setup-for-your-instance#set-a-password-for-an-instance) when creating a Linux VM, you can't connect to that VM via the Gcore Customer Portal. Instead, [connect with SSH keys](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-via-ssh).

    <Info>
    **Info**

    If your VM is located only in a private subnet, the [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol](/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance#enable-DHCP) must be enabled in the settings of this subnet so you can log in with a password.

    4\. Log in using the following credentials:

      * **login** : This information is displayed next to the **Access to Console** link in the format `[login]@[ip-of your-VM]`. Typically, the login is the same as the name of the OS. For example, `ubuntu`.

      * **password** : Enter the password you configured in the user data field in the "Additional options" section when creating the instance.

    <Tip>
    **Tip**

    If you forgot your password, you can find it in the system by connecting to the VM via SSH. Run the `sudo cat /var/lib/cloud/instance/user-data.txt` command and view a password in the following line: `password: [your password]`. If you entered the password as a hash, you will see the hash on the screen. In this case, you will not be able to check the password.
    </Tip>

    You've successfully connected to the Virtual Machine.
