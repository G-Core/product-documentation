## Step 2. Configure the image

Select the type of hardware architecture on which your VM will be running:

- **x86-64** : This architecture is known for its broad compatibility with Linux operating systems and Windows distributions. It is commonly used in general purpose computing applications.
- **ARM** : ARM architecture is designed for energy efficiency and low power consumption, which also supports strong performance, making it ideal for high-performance computing tasks. However, ARM Virtual Machines are compatible with fewer OS distributions.

<Frame>
  ![Choose x86-64 or ARM architecture](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create/configure-image.png)
</Frame>

Your choice of hardware architecture will affect the available OS options and VM flavors. Choose an OS distribution, a volume, a snapshot, a custom image, or a template from the marketplace.

## Step 3. Choose the VM type

Select the appropriate CPU generation:

- **Intel® Xeon® Scalable, 3rd Gen or 2nd Gen** if you've selected x-86-64 architecture at the previous step.
- **ARM Ampere® Altra® Max Family** if you selected ARM architecture in the previous step.

Choose one of the available flavors.

    <Info>
      **Info**

      If your VM has several subnetworks, [ ensure that only one subnetwork is routable](/cloud/networking/create-and-manage-a-subnetwork#set-up-the-default-gateway). Otherwise, there will be a conflict with the default gateway on the server, and you might not be able to connect to the VM.
    </Info>
    Select an existing subnetwork from the dropdown list or create a new one by clicking **Add a new subnetwork**.

    <Frame>
      ![Add a new subnetwork](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create/add-new-subnetwork.png)
    </Frame>
    If you choose to add a new subnetwork, a new window will open where you'll configure the subnetwork settings:

    1. Enter the subnetwork name.

    2. Set CIDR between ranges: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0—172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0—192.168.255.255. Set the mask between 16 and 29.

    3. (optional) Turn on the **Enable DHCP** toggle to assign IP addresses to machines in the subnet automatically.

    4. (optional) Turn on the **Non-routable subnetwork** toggle to block access to the subnet from external networks and other subnets. If you keep the network routable, you can specify the **Gateway IP** address. Otherwise, a random IP address will be assigned.

## Step 6. Configure firewall settings

For **Firewall settings**, select the default firewall or create a new one by clicking **Add firewall**.

<Frame>
  ![The Firewall settings](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/10-firewall-settings.png)
</Frame>

If you keep the default firewall, the incoming traffic will be allowed over ICMP, TCP (SSH), and RDP protocols.

If you want to create a new firewall, refer to our article on [adding and configuring a firewall](/cloud/networking/add-and-configure-a-firewall).

## Step 7. Set up authentication

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux Virtual Machine">
    Configure an SSH key for a remote SSH connection. You can add an existing SSH key or generate a new one. For instructions on how to generate and configure the key, check out this guide: [Connect to a VM via SSH](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-via-ssh).

    <Frame>
      ![SSH keys section with three options: select, generate, or add a new SSH key](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/11-ssh-key.png)
    </Frame>
    In addition to SSH keys, you can also set up a password for your Virtual Machine, as described in step 9. Setting a password is necessary if you want to connect to a Linux VM [from the Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-control-panel#connect-to-a-linux-instance).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows Virtual Machine">
    Configure **Access** by setting a password for the Admin user.

    <Frame>
      ![Access field with a password](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/12-access-for-windows-instance.png)
    </Frame>
    <Info>
      **Info**

      Your password must contain between 8 and 16 characters, including at least one lowercase letter (`a-z`), one uppercase letter (`A-Z`), one number (`0-9`), and one special character (`!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~`).
    </Info>
    You can use the password to connect to a Windows VM from the [Gcore Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-control-panel) or from your computer using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 8 (optional). Configure additional options

Enable the **User data** toggle to customize your VM during the initial boot by a `cloud-init` agent.

<Frame>
  ![User data field with password configuration](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/13-add-user-data.png)
</Frame>

You can configure your password to connect to your Linux VM [from the Customer Portal](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-control-panel) or [via SSH](/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-via-ssh). To do so, insert the following code to the field, replacing `**your password**` with your chosen password:

```yaml
#cloud-config 
password: **your password** 
chpasswd: { expire: False } 
ssh_pwauth: True
```

<Info>
  **Info**

  On Cloud VMs with Windows OS, you can't use the `password` parameter both in the "Access" and "User data" fields. Since the "Access" field is required, configuring user data on Windows Virtual Machines is not possible. Read more about the allowed VM parameters in our [API docs](https://api.gcore.com/docs/cloud#tag/Instances/operation/InstanceCreateSetV2.post).
</Info>

<Accordion title="Configure a password hash">
  You can configure the password hash, a machine-readable set of symbols. It'll protect your real password from being compromised. To generate a hash, use the Python script:

  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env python3  
  \# based on [https://stackoverflow.com/a/17992126/117471](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17992126/117471)\# pip3 install passlib  
  import sys  
  from getpass import getpass  
  from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt  
  passwd = input() if not sys.stdin.isatty() else getpass()  
  print(sha512_crypt.hash(passwd, rounds = 5000 ))
  ```
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  **Warning**

  If a VM is only in a private subnet, DHCP must be enabled in the settings of this subnet, so you can log in with a password.
</Warning>

- Turn on **Add tags** to add a key-value pair that forms the metadata of the Virtual Machine description.

<Frame>
  ![The field to add tags](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/14-add-tags.png)
</Frame>

- Turn on **Add to placement group** to determine how to place multiple VMs.

<Frame>
  ![The field to add the VM to a placement group](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/15-add-placement-group.png)
</Frame>

<Accordion title="Types of placement groups">
  You can place your VM in one of three types of groups:

  - **Affinity** groups assemble virtual machines on the same hardware. Machines launched in one affinity group will exchange data faster because they are located on the same server.
  - **Anti-affinity** groups work the opposite way: All Virtual Machines in this group will be separated across different physical hardware. This increases fault tolerance of a cluster: Even if something goes wrong with one server, machines on the other servers will remain available.
  - **Soft anti-affinity** groups encourage, but don't strictly enforce, the separation of Virtual Machines. Unlike a strict anti-affinity policy, where machines may never be placed together, soft anti-affinity allows placement on the same hardware when it is necessary due to factors like resource constraints or high demand. It is suitable for users who want to use the anti-affinity policy by default while also avoiding machine creation failures if an unused host is not found.
</Accordion>

You can add the VM to an existing placement group or create a new one by clicking **Add placement group**.

## Step 9. Specify the number of VMs

Indicate how many machines with the same configuration you need and name the VMs.

<Frame>
  ![The field to set the number of instances](/images/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance/16-number-of-instances.png)
</Frame>

The maximum number is limited by your quotas.

For names, use Latin characters, underscores, spaces, and dots.

## Step 10. Create a VM

Click **Create virtual machine**.

Your server will be transitioned to the **Building** status. The system will allocate resources for your Virtual Machine.

After that, the server will be automatically moved to the **Power on** status. Your machine is ready to run\!
