Gcore Container as a Service (CaaS) is a cloud service that allows our customers to run containers without Kubernetes or VM management. We at Gcore take care of infrastructure maintenance and scaling on your behalf. 

To use CaaS, choose a supported region, pull the image of the container, and manage it via the customer portal or REST API. We have a [separate article about creating and managing containers](/cloud/caas/manage-containers).
