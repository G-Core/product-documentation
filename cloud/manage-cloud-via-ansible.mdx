title: Manage cloud resources via Ansible
sidebarTitle: Ansible
---

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a configuration management tool used for provisioning, deploying, and orchestrating IT resources. Similarly to [using Terraform](/cloud/manage-cloud-via-terraform), you can use Ansible to create and set up Gcore Cloud services. 

You can find all Ansible modules and plugins required to interact with the Gcore Cloud in the [Ansible Galaxy Collection for Gcore Cloud](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/gcore/cloud/docs/) and in our official [ansible-collection-gcore](https://github.com/G-Core/ansible-collection-gcore) repository. 

## Install and configure Ansible

There are several methods for installing Ansible that depend on the type of your machine's operating system.

<Tip>
**Tip**

If you already have Ansible installed, ensure that you're using the recommended version of Python: 3.11 or higher. To check your Ansible and Python versions and get more details about the configuration, run `ansible â€“version`.
</Tip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Install Ansible on Ubuntu">
    Run the following command: `apt-get install ansible`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Install Ansible on CentOS">
      1\. Install Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL): 

      ```sh
      yum install epel-release 
      ```

      2\. Install Python 3.11 or higher. 

      ```sh
      yum install python3.11
      ```

      3\. Install Ansible in your environment: 

      ```sh
      yum install ansible 
      ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Install Ansible via Python's pipx">
    You can also use pipx to install Ansible on most systems. For details, check out the [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible-with-pipx).

## Add GCore collection from Galaxy

We have a dedicated [Ansible Galaxy Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/gcore/cloud/docs/) that contains all modules and plugins you need for interacting with the Gcore Cloud. 

To install the collection, run the following command: 

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install gcore.cloud 
```

You can now use all modules and plugins provided by the collection to manage your resources in the Gcore Cloud. 

## Validate Ansible configuration

To ensure that everything works as expected, run a test playbook according to the following instructions. 

1\. Configure the playbook: 

```yaml
- name: Gather Gcore instances info 
  hosts: localhost 
  vars: 
    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3.11 
  tasks: 
    - gcore.cloud.instance_info: 
        api_key: "add your api key" 
        region_name: "specify region" 
        project_id: "add your project ID"

```

<Accordion title="Descriptions of the configuration parameters">
* `api_key`: The API key created in the Gcore Customer Portal in the profile settings. 
 * `region_name`: A region in which your cloud resource is created. 
 * `project_id`: An ID of the project that contains your cloud resources. You can check the ID in the Gcore Customer Portal on the Projects page.
</Accordion>

<Info>
**Info**

In the playbook configuration, add the ansible_python_interpreter: `/usr/bin/python3.11` variable only if your Python version is lower than the recommended `3.11`.
</Info>

2\. Start the playbook: `ansible-playbook ./get_instance.yaml -v`.

3\. If you correctly configured Ansible, you should see one of the following: 

  * If you have any instances created in the specified region, you'll get a summary of their setup. 
  * In case you have no cloud resources created in the specified region, you'll get an empty response.



## Manage cloud resources

Use modules and plugins from our [Ansible Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/gcore/cloud/docs/) to create playbooks customized to your infrastructure requirements and deployment workflows. 

As an example, let's create a `test.yaml` playbook that checks your quota limits creates a virtual instance if you have sufficient quotas. 

To create and run the playbook: 

1\. Initialize a new "create_vm" role template. 

```sh
ansible-galaxy init create_vm
```

2\. Create a new task file in the tasks directory. 

```sh
touch ./create_vm/tasks/check_quota.yaml
```

3\. Configure the task to check if you have enough quotas to create the instance.

```yaml
- name: Check quota before create instance 
  register: returned_data 
  gcore.cloud.instance_quota_info: 
    api_key: "{{ your_api_key }}" 
    region_name: "{{ region_name }}" 
    project_id: "{{ project_id }}" 
    flavor: "{{ flavor }}" 
    names:  ['inst1'] 
    volumes: [ 
        {'size': "{{ size }}", 'source': 'image', 'type_name': "{{ type_name }}"}, 
    ] 
    interfaces: [ 
        {'type': 'external'} 
    ] 
 
- name: Needed quota 
  debug: 
    msg: "{{ returned_data.data }}" 
  when: returned_data.data != {} 
```

4\. Create another task file `touch ./create_vm/tasks/create_vm.yaml`. 

5\. Configure the task to create an instance. 

```yaml
- name: Create instance from volume 
  register: created_vm 
  gcore.cloud.instance: 
    api_key: "{{ your_api_key }}" 
    region_name: "{{ region_name }}" 
    project_id: "{{ project_id }}" 
    command: create 
    flavor: "{{ flavor }}" 
    volumes: [{ 
        'source': 'image', 
        'image_id': "{{ image_id }}", 
        'size': "{{ size }}", 
        'boot_index': 0, 
    }] 
    interfaces: [{ 
        'type': 'external' 
    }] 
    keypair_name: "{{ keypair_name }}" 
  when: returned_data.data == {} 
  
--- 
- name: Created VM Info 
  debug: 
    msg: "{{ created_vm.data }}" 
  when: created_vm is not skipped
```

6\. Add all required tasks to the `create_vm/tasks/main.yml` file:

```yaml
# tasks file for create_vm 
- name: Check quotas to create VM 
  import_tasks: check_quota.yaml 
  
- name: Create VM 
  import_tasks: create_vm.yaml 
 
- name: create_log_file 
  file: 
    path: "{{ path_to_log }}{{ log_filename }}" 
    state: touch 
  
- name: save_log 
  blockinfile: 
    state: present 
    insertafter: EOF 
    dest: "{{ path_to_log }}{{ log_filename }}" 
    marker: "" 
    content: 
      - "{{ returned_data }}" 
      - "{{ created_vm }}"
```

7\. Add any required variables to the `create_vm/vars/main.yml` file. For example:

```yaml
api_key: "PUT_HERE_YOUR_API_KEY" 
region_name: "Frankfurt" 
project_id: "328787" 
flavor: "g2-standard-1-2" 
size: 10 
type_name: "ssd_hiiops" 
image_id: "e72903b6-9b45-463f-834e-7316f7f3ff37" 
keypair_name: "id.rsa" 
path_to_log: "/var/log/" 
log_filename: "create_vm.log" 
```

8\. Create a playbook `test.yaml` to test the "create_vm" role. 

```yaml
- hosts: localhost 
  become: true 
  vars: 
    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3.11 
  roles: 
    - create_vm  
```

9\. Run the playbook: `ansible-playbook test.yaml`.

You should get one of the following outputs:

  * If everything is set up correctly, a new virtual instance will be created. 

  * The information about your instance will appear in the "Created VM Info" task section, and it'll also be written to the log file. 

  * If you don't have sufficient quotas, you'll get the "Needed quota" output, followed by the list of your current and requested quota limits. This information will also be stored in logs. 

  * If you made a mistake in variables (for example, set a wrong flavor), you'll get the "Failed" error. In this case, double-check the playbook configuration and rerun it.
