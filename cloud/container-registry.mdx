title: Container registry
---

Container Registry is a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for managing containerized applications. It functions as a centralized repository where you can store and manage Docker images used across different Gcore products, including [Everywhere Inference](/edge-ai/everywhere-inference), [Container as a Service](/cloud/caas), and [Managed Kubernetes](/cloud/kubernetes/about-gcore-kubernetes).

## How it works

Create a registry to store your OCI-compatible artifacts and configure its access by adding users with the required push and pull permissions. Once the registry is set up, you can push Docker images and manage them according to your requirements.

## Getting started
