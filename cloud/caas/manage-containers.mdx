## Container statuses

A container can have the following statuses: 

  * **Deploying** : The initial setup was successful, and the container works appropriately. 
  * **Pending** : The required resources have been successfully created, but the container hasn't been scheduled to a node yet.
  * **Ready** : The container is up and running. 
  * **Disabled** : You manually disabled the container in settings. 
  * **Error** : There were issues with the image of your container in its initial configuration and as a result, the container didn't work.

### Overview

The **Overview** tab in container settings features the following details: container status, endpoint, description (if you added one during creation), and date of creation. After you create a container, you can't change this information. 

### Image & port

On the **Image & Port** tab, you can add a container startup command, as well as update port and protocol used to connect to the container. You can change these settings at any time.
