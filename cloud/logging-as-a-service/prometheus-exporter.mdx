## What is Prometheus exporter?

The Prometheus exporter is a service that offers OpenSearch index metrics to clients. It provides secure access to user-specific metrics for authenticated users. 

## How does it work?

You configure your Prometheus target, providing the Prometheus exporter endpoint and your Managed Logging credentials using HTTPS Basic Authentication. To get the URL endpoint for your region, open the **Prometheus exporter endpoint** tab and copy the API link.

For example, the Prometheus target configuration for Luxembourg would look like this:

```yaml
- job_name: 'your_awesome_job'
  scrape_interval: 5m
  scrape_timeout: 30s
  scheme: https
  static_configs:
      - targets: ['laas-exporter.k1.luxembourg-1.cloud.gcore.com']
  metrics_path: "/v1/opensearch/indices/metrics"
  basic_auth:
    username: 'yourLaasUsername'
    password: 'yourLaasPassword'
```

The Prometheus exporter endpoint for your region in specified in the Gcore Customer Portal. 

## Understand the key metrics
