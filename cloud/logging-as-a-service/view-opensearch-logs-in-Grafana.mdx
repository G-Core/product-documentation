The [OpenSearch Grafana Data Source](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-opensearch-datasource/?tab=overview) plugin allows you to integrate logs from OpenSearch Dashboards into Grafana. This means that you get a consolidated view of all your metrics in one place and benefit from Grafana's advanced alerting and visualization features. You also gain full control over who can view and manage your logs, ensuring the protection of any sensitive information.

## Step 1. Set up Managed Logging in the GCore customer portal

To enable OpenSearch integration with Grafana, you need to configure Managed Logging in the Gcore Customer Portal. You can find more information in our guide on [configuring Managed Logging and viewing your logs](/cloud/logging-as-a-service/configure-logging-and-view-your-logs).

## Step 2. Install OpenSearch plugin in Grafana

If you've already installed the plugin, skip these instructions and go to **Step 3**.

To install the plugin:

1\. In Grafana, navigate to the **Administration** section and click **Plugins**.

2\. Search for the OpenSearch plugin. In the **State** dropdown, check that **All** is selected. Otherwise, you won't see the plugin in search results.

3\. Click **Install**.

3\. Configure the HTTP parameters:

  * **URL** : Enter the link of OpenSearch API endpoint. You can find the link in the Gcore Customer Portal on the **Logging** page.

  * **Access** : If you select "Server (default)", the URL will be accessible from the Grafana backend/server. If you choose "Browser", the URL will be accessible from the browser.

  * **Allowed cookies** : Specify which cookies are allowed to be included in requests to the OpenSearch endpoint.

  * **Timeout** : Set the maximum waiting time for a response from OpenSearch. This will determine how long Grafana will wait for a response before terminating the connection.
