Changing the time range or domain refreshes all metrics, charts, and widgets automatically.

## Understand dashboard metrics

The metrics section provides a snapshot of overall activity.

Core metrics include:

- **Total requests**: All incoming requests.
- **Detected attacks**: Requests identified as malicious.
- **Prevented attacks**: Requests actively mitigated.
- **Passed requests**: Requests forwarded to the origin.

Metric values are displayed using appropriate scale suffixes (for example, K, M, or B) depending on volume.

Use these metrics to:

- Measure attack volume.
- Evaluate mitigation effectiveness.
- Compare traffic versus malicious activity.

## Analyze the Traffic Timeline

The **Traffic Timeline** visualizes activity over the selected time range.

It displays:

- Total requests.
- Detected attacks.
- Prevented attacks.

The timeline helps:

- Identify spikes in traffic.
- Detect attack waves.
- Correlate mitigation activity with traffic patterns.

Hover over the timeline to view timestamps and corresponding metric values.

Clicking on the timeline navigates to the **Events** page with filters applied based on the selected time range and domain.

## Widgets

WAAP Overview includes widgets that highlight top activity categories.

Each widget displays top values ranked by detected attacks or rule triggers.

</Frame>

Use widgets to:

- Identify the most active attack sources.
- Detect repeated malicious IP addresses.
- Understand which rules are triggered most frequently.
- Analyze which actions are applied most often.

Clicking a widget item opens the **Events** page with relevant filters applied automatically.

## Single-domain dashboard

When a specific domain is selected:

- All metrics reflect traffic and attacks for that domain only.
- Widgets display top values limited to the selected domain.
- Navigation to Events keeps the selected domain filter.

This view is useful for:

- Domain-level investigation.
- Customer-specific reporting.
- Targeted troubleshooting.

## Account-level dashboard

When **All domains** is selected:

- Metrics are aggregated across all registered domains.
- The **Traffic Timeline** reflects combined activity.
- Widgets display top values across the entire account.

This view is useful for:

- Account-wide monitoring.
- Executive reporting.
- Sales demonstrations.
- Identifying high-risk domains.

From the account-level Dashboard, navigation to Events opens a filtered view aligned with the selected scope.

## Scenarios

### Monitor overall security posture

Use account-level metrics and widgets to understand:

- Total attack volume.
- Most targeted assets.
- Most frequent protection actions.

### Start an investigation

If unusual activity is visible in metrics or widgets:

1. Adjust the time range.
2. Click the relevant widget or timeline area.
3. Continue analysis in the **Events** page.

## Best practices

For effective monitoring:

- Review the Dashboard regularly for anomaly detection.
- Compare detected versus prevented attacks to evaluate policy efficiency.
- Use widgets to identify persistent attackers.
- Move to Events for detailed investigation when needed.

WAAP Overview dashboards provide a clear and structured overview of application security, while Events enables deep analysis of individual requests.
