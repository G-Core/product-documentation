If your domain uses APIs hosted on the same domain and you don't have enabled [API Discovery](/waap/api-discovery-and-protection/api-discovery), you can manually add endpoints to the API base path. This will define a communication path for WAAP to expect API requests and protect your endpoints. 

<Info>
**Info**

This setting doesn't add API endpoints to the allowlist.
</Info>

When you enter a path, note that: 

  * Paths are recursively allowed. For example, `api/` allows `api/v1/*`, `api/v2/*`, etc. 

  * Regex/wildcard input is not accepted. Use `api/` instead of `api/*`. 

  * Don't enter the protocol or domain. Use `api/` instead of `https://example.foobar.com/api/`. The domain is automatically added. 

  * Paths are not case-sensitive. `API/` and `api/` are interchangeable. 

  * To add multiple APIs, you must create separate entries.




## Add endpoints to the base path

1\. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **WAAP** > **Domains**.


<Frame>![Domains page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/waap/api-discovery-and-protection/domains-page.png)</Frame>



2\. Choose a domain from the list and click its name to open it. You'll be directed to the **Policies** page. 

3\. In the sidebar, click **API Discovery** > **Domain Settings** > **API Base Path**. 

4\. Enter your endpoint path into the **Host** input field. 

5\. Click the **Add** button, and the endpoint will appear in the table under the **Host** field. 

## To remove endpoints from the base path

1\. Find the relevant endpoint and click the three-dot icon next to it. 

2\. Select **Delete**.

3\. Confirm your action by clicking **Delete** again. 

After you configure the API base path, CAPTCHA and JavaScript validation will be disabled for added endpoints. 

The [DDoS protection](/waap/ddos-protection), [IP reputation](/waap/waap-policies/ip-reputation), and rate limitation features will continue to protect those endpoints. Custom [WAAP rules](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules) and [firewall rules](/waap/ip-security/allow-and-block-ip-addresses) can also impact content delivery via API and potentially block users.
