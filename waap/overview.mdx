Gcore WAAP (web application and API protection) protects your websites, web applications, and APIs from known vulnerabilities and common exploits by applying predefined security policies, built-in rules, and behavioral analysis to incoming requests.

WAAP is designed to work out of the box, but it's also highly customizable: You can create and set up your own rules, adjust policies, and customize WAAP behavior as needed. Our built-in reporting system empowers you to analyze traffic, which helps you better understand how to fine-tune WAAP's protection and adjust custom rules.

WAAP offers the following key features:

- Next-gen WAF
- API discovery and protection
- L7 DDoS protection
- Bot protection and anti-automation
- AI intelligence
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- Robust security policies
- Security insights
- Real-time analytics
