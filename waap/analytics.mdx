The **Events** page provides detailed visibility into traffic and security events processed by WAAP.

This page provides detailed statistics on HTTP requests, displayed as a graph and a table, that can be used to analyze requests, investigate attacks, and review applied protection actions.

### Requests graph

This graph shows information about actions that were applied to incoming requests. The data is displayed in a plot chart format that gives a comprehensive overview of both good and bad requests—potential security threats detected based on a triggered rule.

Some filters use multi-select dropdowns (for example, **Response Codes**, **HTTP Methods**, **Actions**, and **Countries**).
