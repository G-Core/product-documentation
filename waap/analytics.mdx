This page provides detailed statistics on HTTP requests, displayed as a graph and as a table.

### Requests graph

This graph shows information about actions that were applied to incoming requests. The data is displayed in a plot chart format that gives a comprehensive overview of both good and bad requests—potential security threats detected based on a triggered rule.
