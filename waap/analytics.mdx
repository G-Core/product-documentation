The **Events** page provides comprehensive information about incoming traffic to your domain. It features detailed statistics about recent requests, potential threats, and frequently triggered rules, allowing you to fine-tune your WAAP settings based on the analyzed data.

  **Tip**

  If you want to view analytics for a different domain, use the dropdown in the top-right corner of the screen and select the needed domain.
</Tip>

The information on the **Events** page is displayed according to the selected period. At the top of the page, you can use the time frame dropdown to configure the displayed data.

This page provides detailed statistics on HTTP requests, displayed as a graph and as a table.

### Requests graph

This graph shows information about actions that were applied to incoming requests. The data is displayed in a plot chart format that gives a comprehensive overview of both good and bad requests—potential security threats detected based on a triggered rule.

<Frame>
  ![WAAP Events graph](/images/docs/waap/analytics/waap-events-graph.png)
</Frame>

You can select the following filters to view specific types of requests:

- **Monitored Requests**: View requests that were triggered by the [monitor reserved tag](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/tag-rules/reserved-tags#inspect-waap-traffic).
- **Policy - Blocked**: View requests that were blocked because of a triggered default policy.
- **Custom Rule - Blocked**: View requests that were blocked because of a triggered custom rule created in your account.
- **DDoS L7 - Blocked**: View requests that were blocked because of a triggered default rule related to DDoS. To learn more about how requests can trigger this rule, refer to our [L7 DDoS protection](/waap/ddos-protection) guide.
- **Passed to Origin**: View requests that successfully reached the origin.

Any changes made to the WAAP requests plot are also displayed in the **Requests** table below the plot:

- When you click on a particular data point on the plot, the **Requests** table is filtered accordingly. The date, time, and the corresponding traffic type are updated to show information relevant to what you've selected on the plot.
- When you select a specific filter like **Policy - Blocked**, the **Requests** table is filtered to display only information that matches the same filter.

<Tip>
  **Tip**

  Updating filters on the table doesn't change the data displayed on the Web Application Firewall Requests graph.
</Tip>

### Requests table

This table displays incoming requests for the selected time frame, including good and bad ones (potential threats). Request history is retained for 30 days.

You can select multiple filters to get a more granular view of the displayed information in the table.

You can download the table data in the CSV format.

For each logged request, you can perform the following actions:

- Inspect request details
- Create a new rule for the IP address that will challenge requests with JavaScript or CAPTCHA validation or add it to the block or allow list.

#### Request Details

This page provides in-depth information about a particular request made to your domain. It's structured into three sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the request:

- **Reference ID**: This ID is unique to each chain of requests that triggered a particular policy or custom rule. Using the reference ID, you can search your requests to determine why a block [response page](/waap/response-pages) was displayed to that user.

<Frame>
  ![Reference ID on the request details page](/images/docs/waap/analytics/request-details-id-reference.png)
</Frame>

- **Overview**: Provides a high-level summary of the request, including relevant rules and applicable actions, response code, and client details. Click **Filter by** to view all requests coming from the filtered IP.

<Frame>
  ![Overview section on the request details page](/images/docs/waap/analytics/request-details-overview.png)
</Frame>

- **Additional Information**: Includes a detailed overview of the client, associated organization, and device (if available).

<Frame>
  ![Additional information section on the request details page](/images/docs/waap/analytics/request-details-extra-info.png)
</Frame>

- **Headers**: Contains a complete list of HTTP headers included in the client request and response from the server.

<Frame>
  ![Headers section on the request details page](/images/docs/waap/analytics/request-details-headers.png)
</Frame>

- **Tags**: Lists any tags associated with the request, helping you quickly identify malicious activities related to that request.

<Frame>
  ![Tags section on the request details page](/images/docs/waap/analytics/request-details-tags.png)
</Frame>

You can also create a rule for the IP address from which the request originates:

1. In the top-right corner of the screen, click **Create rule for IP**.

<Frame>
  ![Highlighted create rule button on the request details page](/images/docs/waap/analytics/request-details-create-rule.png)
</Frame>

2. Choose the relevant action:

- Allow requests from this IP
- Block requests from this IP
- Challenge requests with CAPTCHA
- Challenge request with JavaScript validation

3. Click **Create rule**.

The rules to block or allow requests will appear on the [Firewall](/waap/ip-security/allow-and-block-ip-addresses) page. The rules to challenge requests with JavaScript or CAPTCHA validation will appear on the [WAAP rules](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/create-and-manage-custom-rules) page.
