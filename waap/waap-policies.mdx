WAAP comes with a set of default policy groups that enhance the security of your web applications by: 

  * Blocking malicious traffic and common attack patterns
  * Preventing data breaches and unauthorized access to your domain
  * Ensuring compliance with security standards
  * Filtering suspicious IP addresses and bot traffic



You can customize WAAP behavior by enabling and disabling specific policies for better alignment with your workflows and security requirements.
