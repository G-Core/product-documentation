We offer three levels of packages to suit your needs: **Start**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise**. Built with scalability in mind, these packages provide enhanced security measures powered by [next-generation algorithms](/waap/about-waap#how-waap-works) to block any attack.

## Trial period

Each paid plan includes a **30-day trial period**. During the trial, you can test all features included in the selected plan. If your usage exceeds the plan's traffic quota during the trial, WAAP will be automatically suspended.

<Info>
  After the trial period ends, you will be charged according to your selected plan's pricing.

## Start plan

This is the most basic package, providing essential protection for your web application. It is a cost-effective solution for smaller sites.
