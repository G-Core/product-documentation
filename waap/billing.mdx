We offer three levels of packages to suit your needs: **Start**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise**. Built with scalability in mind, these packages provide you with enhanced security measures powered by [next-generation algorithms](/waap/about-waap#how-waap-works) to block any attack. The comprehensive package information is available on the [Gcore pricing](https://gcore.com/pricing/edge-network#waap) page.
