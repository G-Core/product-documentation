# Billing

We offer three levels of packages to suit your needs: **Start**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise**. Built with scalability in mind, these packages provide you with enhanced security measures powered by [next-generation algorithms](https://gcore.com/docs/waap/about-waap#how-waap-works) to block any attack.  The comprehensive package information is available on the [Gcore pricing page].

## Trial

You can test the Web Application and API Protection **for 30 days or until you reach 5 GB of traffic**. The following table presents the list of features and quotas available in the trial plan.

<Info>
  Each paid plan has its own trial, so quotas may vary.
