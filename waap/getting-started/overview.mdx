# Overview

This section explains how to get started with Gcore WAAP and enable protection as quickly as possible.

There are two supported onboarding paths:

- **Protect a new resource** – Add a new domain to Gcore and enable WAAP protection.
- **Enable WAAP for an existing CDN resource** – Activate WAAP for a domain already using Gcore CDN.

Both options are designed to provide fast and straightforward protection.
