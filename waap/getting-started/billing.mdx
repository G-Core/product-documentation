## Domains / Zones

A **Domain / Zone** is a billing and configuration unit that represents a group of one or more hostnames (domains or CNAME aliases) mapped to exactly one CDN resource and governed by a single WAAP security policy set.

Each Domain / Zone:

- Is strictly associated with one CDN resource.
- Shares the same origin configuration.
- Shares the same traffic routing.
- Shares the same WAAP policies and security controls.

A Domain / Zone may include multiple domains and aliases, provided they resolve to the same CDN resource and are protected as one logical application surface.

### Example: Multiple domains protected as one application

If several domains and aliases point to the same CDN resource and origin and share identical delivery and security policies, they are treated as **one Domain / Zone** and billed once.

Typical scenarios include:

- Brand or regional domains serving the same site.
- Multiple entry domains for the same SaaS tenant.
- Marketing domains pointing to one application.
- SAN / multi-hostname TLS setups.

### Example: One domain split into multiple protected surfaces

If application components are separated across different CDN resources (for example, API, admin, or portal), each resource creates a separate Domain / Zone and is billed independently.

Typical scenarios include:

- API and web frontend separation.
- Admin or back-office isolation.
- Microservice exposure via subdomains.
- Different security posture per surface.

## Plan management

WAAP plans are available as either self-serve or sales-assisted offerings.

- **Free**, **Start**, and **Pro** plans are self-serve and can be activated directly through the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard).
- The **Enterprise** plan is available through direct engagement with [Gcore Sales](https://gcore.com/waap-contact-sales) and supports custom terms and enterprise agreements.

### Trial

Each paid plan includes a **30-day trial period**.

During the trial, all features included in the selected plan are available.

After the trial period ends, billing continues according to the selected plan’s pricing.

Organizations requiring procurement support or enterprise-specific capabilities should select the **Enterprise** plan.
