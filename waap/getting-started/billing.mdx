## Domains / Zones

A **Domain / Zone** is a billing and configuration unit that represents a group of one or more hostnames (domains or CNAME aliases) mapped to exactly one CDN resource and governed by a single WAAP security policy set.

Each Domain / Zone:

- Is strictly associated with one CDN resource.
- Shares the same origin configuration.
- Shares the same traffic routing.
- Shares the same WAAP policies and security controls.

A Domain / Zone may include multiple domains and aliases, provided they resolve to the same CDN resource and are protected as one logical application surface.

### Example: Multiple domains protected as one application

If several domains and aliases point to the same CDN resource and origin and share identical delivery and security policies, they are treated as **one Domain / Zone** and billed once.

Typical scenarios include:

- Brand or regional domains serving the same site.
- Multiple entry domains for the same SaaS tenant.
- Marketing domains pointing to one application.
- SAN / multi-hostname TLS setups.

### Example: One domain split into multiple protected surfaces

If application components are separated across different CDN resources (for example, API, admin, or portal), each resource creates a separate Domain / Zone and is billed independently.

Typical scenarios include:

- API and web frontend separation.
- Admin or back-office isolation.
- Microservice exposure via subdomains.
- Different security posture per surface.

## Plan management

WAAP plans are available as either self-serve or sales-assisted offerings.

- **Free**, **Start**, and **Pro** plans are self-serve and can be activated directly through the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard).
- The **Enterprise** plan is available through direct engagement with [Gcore Sales](https://gcore.com/waap-contact-sales) and supports custom terms and enterprise agreements.

### Trial

When a WAAP plan is activated, a trial period applies according to the selected plan.

- Paid plans include a 30-day trial with full access to the features available in that plan.
- Service usage is limited by the included traffic and plan quotas.
- The trial ends when 30 days have elapsed or when the included quota is exceeded.

A credit card is not required to start.

If no payment method is added and the included quota is reached, service consumption is stopped.

If a credit card is added, service continues without interruption. Usage remains free until the included quota is reached. Any usage beyond the included quota is billed according to the selected plan.
