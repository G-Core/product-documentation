Feature availability may vary depending on the selected subscription plan.

## Domains / Zones

A Domain / Zone is a WAAP billing and configuration unit.

It represents one CDN resource with a single WAAP configuration. Multiple domains and aliases can be grouped into the same Domain / Zone when they:

- Redirect to the same origin.
- Share the same CDN configuration.
- Use the same WAAP security settings.

In this case, all linked domains are managed as one configuration and billed as one Domain / Zone.

A single domain can also be split into multiple configurations. For example:

- `portal.domain.com`
- `admin.domain.com`
- `api.domain.com`

If these subdomains are mapped to different CDN resources and require separate WAAP configurations, each one is counted and billed as a separate Domain / Zone.

## Plan management

WAAP plans are available as either self-serve or sales-assisted offerings.

- **Free**, **Start**, and **Pro** plans are self-serve and can be activated directly through the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard).
- The **Enterprise** plan is available through direct engagement with [Gcore Sales](https://gcore.com/waap-contact-sales) and supports custom terms and enterprise agreements.

### Trial

When a WAAP plan is activated, a trial period applies according to the selected plan.

- Paid plans include a 30-day trial with full access to the features available in that plan.
- Service usage is limited by the included traffic and plan quotas.
- The trial ends when 30 days have elapsed or when the included quota is exceeded.

A credit card is not required to start.

If no payment method is added and the included quota is reached, service consumption is stopped.

If a credit card is added, service continues without interruption. Usage remains free until the included quota is reached. Any usage beyond the included quota is billed according to the selected plan.
