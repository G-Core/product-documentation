sidebarTitle: Predefined tags
---

We offer a range of predefined tags that you can use to filter and sanction web requests. These tags are generated by a behavioral component, which analyzes the traffic based on heuristics and AI models. Using these tags, you can configure tag-based rules both in the Customer Portal and via API. 

Check the following table for a full list of predefined tags, their API slugs, and descriptions. For details on how to create tag-based rules, check our [dedicated guide](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/tag-rules).
