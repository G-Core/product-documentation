Reserved tags are preconfigured tags that trigger specific actions in custom rules. They play a key role in [tag-generating rules](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/tag-rules#tag-generating-rules)—each rule contains a reserved tag in its [condition](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules#rule-conditions). 

## Available reserved tags

Reserved tags can be divided into two categories: **general** tags that are used in custom rules with various conditions and **API protection** tags that are specifically designed to protect your APIs. [API protection](/waap/api-discovery-and-protection/configure-api-access-with-reserved-tags) tags contain the URL rule condition. 

General tags: 

  * Registered 
  * Logged In 
  * Paid
  * Monitor 
  * Ignored Automation 
  * Login Page 
  * Legitimate Activity 
  * Malicious Activity 
  * Item Added to Cart 
  * Cart Checkout



API protection tags: 

  * API Privileged Access 
  * API Admin Access 
  * Indicate API Privileged User 
  * Indicate API Admin User 
  * Ignore Email Address Detection 
  * Ignore Phone Number Detection 
  * Auth Endpoint 
  * Ignore CCN Detection 
  * Ignore SSN Detection



Unlike [user-defined tags](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/tag-rules#tag-generating-rules) that are automatically generated based on specific request conditions, reserved tags aren't customizable. However, you can use them to create a variety of rules, each adjusted to a specific scenario as documented in the following sections.

## Tag requests from logged-in, registered, or paid users

The **registered**, **logged-in**, and **paid** tags allow you to identify requests from users who have created accounts on your domain, are authenticated, or have paid subscriptions. 

When creating a rule, make sure that you specify a secure condition. For example, explicitly define the IP address from which the requests will be coming (e.g., IP=1.2.3.4). Don't use the conditions that are easy to spoof, such as the User Agent header. 

You can also use a server signal that will serve as a unique identifier and can verify the client. For instance, apply a tag based on a session cookie or a specific HTTP response header. 

For example, you can create the rule that looks for the X-Registered header, which designates registered users:

Alternatively, you can inject a header for logged-in users. WAAP will use this header to tag the request. After the WAAP generates such tags, they will be integrated with our security cloud and associated with the user session. All tags that indicate harmful behavior will be cleaned for the user.

## Inspect WAAP traffic

If you want to track certain traffic on the [WAAP analytics](/waap/analytics#web-application-firewall-requests) page, use the reserved **monitor** tag. Each request marked with this tag will appear: 

  * On the **Web Application Firewall Requests** graph. Enable the **Monitored Requests** checkbox to view all tagged requests. 

  * In the **Requests** table. Select the **Monitored** traffic type to view the tagged requests.



<Frame>![WAAP requests graph on the Analytics page](/images/docs/waap/waap-rules/tag-rules/monitored-tag-analytics-page.png)</Frame>



When you add the monitor tag to a request, it won't affect WAAP's behavior. If the request is potentially dangerous, it will be blocked. The monitor tag only ensures that such requests are visible on the [WAAP](/waap/analytics#waap-page) analytics page.

### Sample rule with the monitor tag

As an example, create a rule that will allow you to view analytics on monitored requests from particular countries: 

1\. In the **IF** section, select **Country** from the dropdown. 

2\. In the following dropdown, select **-** to apply the rule to every request that comes from the relevant country. 

3\. Select **Equals** to trigger the rule only when the request comes from the specified country. 

4\. Choose the needed country from the list. 

5\. In the **THEN** section, select the **Tag** action and choose **Monitor**. 

6\. Click **Save** to create the rule. 


<Frame>![A custom rule for tagging requests from certain countries](/images/docs/waap/waap-rules/tag-rules/monitored-tag-certain-countries.png)</Frame>



All monitored requests will now be displayed on the [WAAP analytics](/waap/analytics#web-application-firewall-requests) page.

## Ignore automation services

This functionality will notify WAAP of legitimate automation behavior and exclude requests from being affected by our [Anti-automation and bot protection](/waap/waap-policies/anti-automation-and-bot-protection) policy group. This means that you stay protected from unknown automation services while allowing known bots to access your domain. 

To allow the activity of some automation services, create a custom rule with the **Ignored Automation** tag: 

1\. In the **IF** section, select **User Agent** from the dropdown. 

2\. In the following dropdown, select **-** to apply the rule to every request that comes from the relevant bot. In this example, "mybot".

3\. Enter the bot in the **User Agent** field. 

4\. In the **THEN** section, select the **Tag** action and choose **Ignored Automation**.

5\. Click **Save** to create the rule. 

WAAP will apply no actions to the activity of "mybot". 

## Protect login pages

Use this tag to notify WAAP if certain endpoints are used as login pages. This functionality will help identify such threats such as brute force attacks. 

To identify login pages for the WAAP, create the following custom rule: 

1\. In the **IF** section, select **URL** from the dropdown. 

2\. In the following dropdown, select **-** to apply the rule to the exact endpoint. 

3\. Provide the login page endpoint. 

4\. In the **THEN** section, select the **Tag** action and choose **Login Page**.

5\. Click **Save** to create the rule. 

## Detect malicious and legitimate activity

Gcore WAAP has preconfigured thresholds that identify and tag requests as malicious or legitimate. This works as follows: 

1\. Our heuristic models check for good and bad behavioral patterns associated with a particular request. 

2\. Based on the analyzed behavior, the request is tagged as either malicious or legitimate. The relevant tag sticks to the client based on identifiers like the IP or session data. 

3\. If the client behavior changes, our heuristic models can remove the previous tag and update it either to a legitimate or malicious one. However, the tag can only be replaced after the client consistently demonstrates a particular behavior, meeting the defined **threshold**. This threshold represents the number of times a request has to be tagged as malicious or legitimate until it sticks to the client. 

For example, if the threshold for declined orders is set to three, and the threshold for successful orders is set to two, then a client would be considered a legitimate actor if it made two successful orders after being wrong twice. 

### Sample rule with the legitimate and malicious activity tags

Using the **legitimate activity** and **malicious activity** tags, you can categorize particular requests based on the behavior they exhibit. To do so, create the following custom rule: 

1\. In the **IF** section, select **Header** from the dropdown. 

2\. In the **Header key** field, enter cookie. 

3\. In the following dropdown, select **-** to apply the rule to the exact header. 

4\. Select **Contains** to trigger the rule even when the header partially matches the specified one. 

5\. In the **Header** key field, enter paid. 

6\. In the **THEN** section, select the **Tag** action and choose **Legitimate Activity**.


<Frame>![A custom rule for tagging requests from paid users](/images/docs/waap/waap-rules/tag-rules/tag-paid-users-activity.png)</Frame>



7\. Click **Save**. 

After you create the rule, requests from paid users will be treated as safe and the ones demonstrating legitimate activity.

## Detect denial of inventory

You can create custom rules with reserved tags to prevent denial of inventory (inventory hoarding) attacks. 

This mitigation method aims to detect hoarder bots that use endpoints to rapidly add items to a cart without completing the purchase. 

WAAP will calculate the number of items in each client's cart and compare the number to the threshold configured by support. If the threshold is exceeded and the client doesn't check out the order, WAAP will tag this client as hoarderbot. 

To detect denial of inventory, create the following rule: 

1\. In the **IF** section, select **URL** from the dropdown. 

2\. In the next dropdown, select **-** to apply the rule only to the specified condition. 

3\. Define match criteria. Select **Contains** to apply the rule even when a URL partly matches the specified one. 

4\. Enter the **checkout.aspx** in the URL field. 

5\. In the **THEN** section, select the **Tag** action and choose the **Cart Checkout** tag.


<Frame>![A custom rule to detect denial of inventory attacks](/images/docs/waap/waap-rules/tag-rules/tag-cart-checkout.png)</Frame>



6\. Click **Save** to create the rule.

Similarly, create a rule that will check for the number of items added to the cart and enforce relevant actions on similar requests: 

1\. In the **IF** section, select **URL** from the dropdown. 

2\. In the next dropdown, select **-** to apply the rule only to the specified condition. 

3\. Define match criteria. Select **Contains** to apply the rule even when a URL partly matches the specified one. 

4\. Enter the **addtocart.aspx** in the **URL** field. 

5\. In the **THEN** section, select the **Tag** action and apply the **Item Added to Cart** tag to each request that matches the specified criteria.

6\. Click **Save** to create the rule.

## Use reserved tags for API protection

There's a range of tags that you can use to manage access to API endpoints. These tags include: 

  * API Privileged Access 
  * API Admin Access 
  * Indicate API Privileged User 
  * Indicate API Admin User 
  * Auth Endpoint 
  * Ignore Email Address Detection 
  * Ignore Phone Number Detection
