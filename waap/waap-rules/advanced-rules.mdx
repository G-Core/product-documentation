Similarly to WAAP [custom rules](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules), you can create, edit, and manage advanced custom rules. These rules also contain "If/Then" statements, but they support more complex conditions created with the [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) syntax.

## Create advanced rules

Due to the highly technical aspect of the advanced rules functionality, the ability to create and edit these rules is currently only available through our API.

Check out the following guides for details on how to create advanced rules and their key components:

- [API docs](https://api.gcore.com/docs/waap): Learn how to construct and manage advanced rules.
- [Advanced rule objects and attributes](/waap/waap-rules/advanced-rules/advanced-rule-objects): Get the list of all available objects you can use in rule expressions along with their respective attributes and types.
- [Source field objects](/waap/waap-rules/advanced-rules/source-field-objects): Check the available source field objects you can use in your expressions along with their respective attributes and types.

## Advanced rule properties

The advanced rule object contains the following properties:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "",
  "enabled": true,
  "action": {
    "allow": {},
    "block": {
      "status_code": 403,
      "action_duration": "string"
    },
    "captcha": {},
    "handshake": {},
    "tag": {
      "tags": [
        "string"
      ]
    }
  },
  "source": "string",
  "phase": "access"
}
```

  **Info**

  Each rule can contain only one action—`block`, `allow`, `captcha`, `handshake`, or `tag`. If you use multiple actions in a single rule, the API will return an error.

## Best practices

You can use our API documentation as a guide in constructing your own advanced rules. The following sections demonstrate a few examples of advanced rules created via our API using cURL.

### Rate limiting

You can rate limit IPs based on the number of requests they make to your website. This is useful for blocking scrapers or bots that make too many requests in a short period.

You can find more examples in our [Rate limiting](https://gcore.com/docs/waap/waap-rules/advanced-rules/advanced-rate-limiting-rules) guide.

The following rule limits the rate of requests an IP can send for 10 minutes, when it exceeds 200 requests in 5 seconds, but excludes requests from mobile or web clients that have specific cookies.

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "action": {
        "block": {
            "status_code": 403,
            "action_duration": "10m"
        }
    },
    "phase": "access",
    "name": "Block Scrappers",
    "description": "Block IPs that hit more than 200 requests per 5 seconds for any `events` paths",
    "enabled": false,
    "source": "(request.rate_limit([], '.*events', 5, 200, [], [], '', 'ip') and not ('mb-web-ui' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'mb-mobile-ios' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'mobile-android' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'mb-mobile-android' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'session-token' in request.headers['Cookie']) and not request.headers['session']) or tags.exists('penalty')"
}'
```

### The penalty tag

The WAAP system appends the `penalty` tag to the local IP record when an IP address is convicted by a rule enforcing a block action, provided that the block action is configured with the `action_duration` parameter.

To ensure continued blocking of the offending IP address after the specific rule’s conditions have expired, it is crucial to incorporate the `penalty` tag into the rule’s source conditions. This can be achieved by including a tag check within the rule itself, such as an expression like `tags.exists('penalty')`. Alternatively, you can define a separate rule that explicitly targets requests carrying the `penalty` tag. Below is an illustrative example of how to implement such a configuration effectively.

#### Block all penalty requests

The following rule will block all requests with the `penalty` tag. This ensures `block` actions triggered by any rule will be enforced.

Creating a separate rule for the `penalty` tag is useful when you have exhausted the 5 tags limit in a single rule.

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "action": {"block": {}},
    "phase": "access",
    "name": "Block Penalized Requests",
    "description": "Block requests that are detected with `penalty` tag",
    "enabled": false,
    "source": "tags.exists('penalty')"
}'
```

### Validate a set of countries

Use JavaScript validation to challenge IPs that are coming from countries without certain cookies:

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "action": {
        "handshake": {}
    },
    "phase": "access",
    "name": "Validate set of countries",
    "description": "Validate with JavaScript challenge IPs that are coming from the following countries",
    "enabled": false,
    "source": "whois.country in ['BR', 'VN', 'ID', 'TH', 'ME', 'XK', 'LK'] and not ('mb-web-ui' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'mb-mobile-ios' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'mobile-android' in request.headers['Cookie'] or 'mb-mobile-android' in request.headers['Cookie'])
}'
```

### Add clients to allow list

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "action": {
        "allow": {}
    },
    "name": "Whitelist known IPs",
    "enabled": false,
    "source": "request.ip == '117.20.32.5' or request.ip == '117.20.32.4' or request.ip_in_range('72.21.217.0', '72.21.217.255')"
}'
```

### Tag and allow registered clients

Make sure that the tag value is enclosed in the double-quotes character (").

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "Tag registered clients",
    "description": "Detect and tag registered clients by cookie",
    "source": "'mb-mobile-android' in request.headers['Cookie']",
    "action": {
        "tag": {
            "tags": ["registered"]
        }
    }
}'
```

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "Allow registered clients",
    "description": "Allow registered clients",
    "source": "tags.exists('registered')",
    "action": {
        "allow": {}
    }
}'
```

### Define login pages

```sh
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.gcore.com/waap/v1/domains/{domain_id}/advanced-rules \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "Detect and Tag Login Pages",
    "source": "['url1/login','url2/signup'] in request.uri",
    "action": {
        "tag": {
            "tags": ["login page"]
        }
    }
}'
```

## Review existing rules

After you create advanced rules, they will appear on the **WAAP rules** page in the Gcore Customer Portal. You can enable or disable the rules by clicking the relevant toggles.
