Use this guide to troubleshoot cases when WAAP displays a block or challenge [response page](/waap/response-pages) to your users. 

When a user is presented with a response page, they will see the following information: 

  * **Reference ID** : This ID is unique to each chain of requests that triggered a particular policy or custom rule. By using reference ID, you can search through your requests and determine why a security screen was displayed to that user. 

  * **IP addres** s: IP address of the client that made the request. 

  * **Date and time** : A date and time when the request was made.




This information can also be useful for diagnostic purposes and troubleshooting. If you encounter issues with a specific page and require assistance from our support team, we recommend providing these details in your support request.

This information helps you understand why a user was blocked or challenged. Thus, you can decide if the user's behavior is acceptable and they can access your domain or should remain blocked. After analyzing the request details, you can create WAAP rules to block or allow the user.
