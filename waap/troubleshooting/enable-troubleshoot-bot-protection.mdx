Hackers use bots to scan a web application's front-end environment and exploit vulnerabilities for access and control.

Gcore [anti-automation and bot protection](/waap/waap-policies/anti-automation-and-bot-protection) detects, prevents, and blocks unauthorized vulnerability scans from directly reaching your application. This feature denies hackers the ability to map your site and plan malicious activities.

Our bot mitigation solution uses the following methods to prevent attackers from accessing your application:

- **User-Agent detection**. Requests with invalid (known to be malicious) or missing User-Agent strings will be blocked.
- **Analysis of traffic sources**. Requests from hosting services, TOR exit nodes, proxy, or VPN networks will be required to pass a Handshake (JavaScript validation).
- **Behavioral analysis**. Requests with unusual user behavior will be challenged or blocked.
- **Headless browsers and automated clients**. Requests from headless browsers [will be tagged](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/tag-rules/predefined-tags) by our security cloud (behavioral engine) and will have to pass a Handshake (JavaScript validation).

## View and enable known bots

WAAP allows known bots and services listed in the Known Bots section. To view the list and enable or disable bots:

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **WAAP** \> **Bot Management**.

2. In the domain dropdown at the top of the page, select the needed domain.

3. Click the **Known Bots** tab to view the list of allowed bots.

4. Review the list of accepted bots and adjust the list as needed.

  If you want to add a new bot to the list, contact [Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) and provide the details. We'll consider adding that bot in the future.

## Enable the "Lets Encrypt" policy

Lets Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority that provides server-side SSL certificates. Use the following instructions to enable the **Lets Encrypt** policy that will validate requests to create or renew SSL certificates:

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **WAAP** \> **Bot Management**.

2. In the domain dropdown at the top of the page, select the needed domain.

3. Click the **Known Bots** tab to view the list of allowed bots.

4. Find the **Lets Encrypt** policy and set its mode to **Allow** or **Policy-based**.

5. If a renewal is successful, you'll see the confirmation message "Congratulations, all renewals succeeded." If a renewal is not successful, you'll get an error message informing you that renewal attempts have failed.

## Troubleshoot known bots

If you notice that a known crawler or bot is not working or is blocking you, check the following troubleshooting recommendations.

### Verify that the bot is allowed

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard), navigate to **WAAP** \> **Bot Management**.

2. In the domain dropdown at the top of the page, select the needed domain. Click the **Known Bots** tab.

3. Find the needed bot and make sure that its mode is set to **Allow** or **Policy-based**.

### Check security actions enforced on a request

If the bot is set to **Allow** or **Policy-based** in the **Known Bots** section, review the security action.

When WAAP challenges or blocks bots' requests to your domain, a block response page will be displayed. This page contains a reference ID, which can be used to check the security actions enforced on the request.

If you don't see a reference ID, then you can open each security event until you find a user agent that matches the bot.

Check the [Troubleshooting blocked users](/waap/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-blocked-users) for detailed instructions on how to inspect and fix such issues.
