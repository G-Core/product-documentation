WAAP rules allow you to specify how to inspect web requests to your domain and what actions to take when a request matches certain criteria. This helps protect your applications from common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other malicious activities. 

For example, you can create a rule to block any request with common SQL injection patterns or require CAPTCHA validation to prevent spam. 

## What rules can you create?

Depending on your [plan](/waap/billing), you can create the following rules: 

  * [Firewall rules](/waap/ip-security/allow-and-block-ip-addresses) (allow and block IP addresses): Easy to configure and designed for use cases when you need a straightforward, simple tool to manage IP access to your domain. These rules form access control lists (ACLs) and are free for any plan that includes our WAAP product. 

  * [Custom rules](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules): These rules contain "if/then" statements and cover more complicated scenarios, such as filtering requests from specified countries or organizations.

  * [Advanced rules](/waap/waap-rules/advanced-rules): Designed for technical users who need even more control over rule creation. Can be configured via API and are available within the WAAP [Enterprise plan](/waap/billing#enterprise).




## Rule criteria

For any WAAP rule, it's important to define the criteria that will put that rule into action. You can create WAAP rules based on a variety of conditions: 

  * Origin of the IP or IP range. 

  * Country or geographical location of the request. 

  * Length of a specified part of the request, such as query string. 

  * Strings that appear in the request. For example, values that appear in the user-agent header or text strings from the query string. 

  * Specific [tags](/waap/waap-rules/custom-rules/tag-rules/predefined-tags). 

  * SQL code that's likely to be malicious and used to extract data from your database, also known as SQL injection. 

  * Requests with potentially malicious scripts that can exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. This is known as cross-site scripting (XSS). 

  * Some rule types take sets of criteria. For example, you can specify up to 10,000 IP addresses or IP address ranges in an IP address rule.
