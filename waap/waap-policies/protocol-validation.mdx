The protocol validation policy group verifies the HTTP and HTTPS protocols used by clients to request content from your website's origin server. If the request meets the protocol-specific requirements, the transaction is allowed, while all non-compliant transactions are blocked. 

## Configure protocol validation rules

You can review and configure protocol validation rules in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard): 

1\. Navigate to **WAAP** > **Bot Management**. 

2\. In the domain dropdown at the top of the page, select the needed domain.

3\. The **Bot Attacks** tab contains protocol validation rules such as Invalid user agent and Unknown user agent.

 <Info>
**Info**

All protocol validation policies are enabled by default. To change the policy mode, click the **Mode** dropdown and select **Protection** or **Disabled**.

### Service protocol validation

Block clients that try to interfere with the service's internal calls, such as tampering with cookies or request headers. 

### Prevent malformed request methods

Enforce HTTP RFC requirements that define how the client is supposed to interact with the server. If the requests don't meet the RFC standards, the client will be challenged with CAPTCHA or JavaScript validation. Clients that fail to pass the validation will be blocked.
