The protocol validation policy group verifies the HTTP and HTTPS protocols used by clients to request content from your website's origin server. If the request meets the protocol-specific requirements, the transaction is allowed, while all non-compliant transactions are blocked. 

## Configure policy group

You can review the Protocol validation policy group and enable or disable its policies in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard): 

1\. Navigate to **WAAP** > **Domains**. 


<Frame>![Domains page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/waap/waap-policies/domains-waap-page.png)</Frame>



2\. Find the domain where you want to configure the policy group and click the domain name to open it. 

3\. On the **Policies** page that opens, click **Protocol validation** to expand the section and adjust the policies.

**Info**

All protocol validation policies are enabled by default. To enable or disable a policy, turn on the toggle near that policy.

### Invalid user agent and unknown user agent

These two WAAP policies work together to identify and block requests that lack a standard user-agent parameter. If the agent is missing, this can indicate that an illegitimate client is being used. 

Most browsers provide user agent information across the network to validate a client's authenticity and purpose. User agent strings typically follow this syntax: 

`User-Agent: <product> / <product-version> <comment>`

Where: 

  * `<product>`: A product identifierâ€”its name or development codename. 

  * `<product-version>`: Version number of the product. 

  * `<comment>`: Comments containing more details. For example, sub-product information.



<Accordion title="Example formats of generated user agents">
This is the common format of a user agent generated by a web browser: 

`User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (<system-information>) <platform> (<platform-details>) <extensions>`

The following is an example of a user agent generated by a Windows XP user browsing a website via Google Chrome: 

`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36`

This user agent indicates that the user is using Windows 10 (Windows NT 10.0), a 64-bit system (Win64; x64), and the latest version of Chrome (98.0.4758.102) at the time of browsing. 

`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36`

This user agent indicates that the user is using macOS (Macintosh), specifically version 10.15.7 (Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7), and the latest version of Chrome (98.0.4758.102) at the time of browsing.

### Service protocol validation

Block clients that try to interfere with the service's internal calls, such as tampering with cookies or request headers. 

### Prevent malformed request methods

Enforce HTTP RFC requirements that define how the client is supposed to interact with the server. If the requests don't meet the RFC standards, the client will be challenged with CAPTCHA or JavaScript validation. Clients that fail to pass the validation will be blocked.
