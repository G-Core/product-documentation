title: 'Invalid user agent and unknown user agent'
---

These two WAAP policies work together to identify and block requests that lack a standard user-agent parameter. If the agent is missing, this can indicate that an illegitimate client is being used. 

Most browsers provide user agent information across the network to validate a client's authenticity and purpose. User agent strings typically follow this syntax: 

`User-Agent: <product> / <product-version> <comment>`

Where: 

  * `<product>`: A product identifier—its name or development codename. 

  * `<product-version>`: Version number of the product. 

  * `<comment>`: Comments containing more details. For example, sub-product information.



<Accordion title="Example formats of generated user agents">
This is the common format of a user agent generated by a web browser: 

`User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (<system-information>) <platform> (<platform-details>) <extensions>`

The following is an example of a user agent generated by a Windows XP user browsing a website via Google Chrome: 

`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36`

This user agent indicates that the user is using Windows 10 (Windows NT 10.0), a 64-bit system (Win64; x64), and the latest version of Chrome (98.0.4758.102) at the time of browsing. 

`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36`

This user agent indicates that the user is using macOS (Macintosh), specifically version 10.15.7 (Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7), and the latest version of Chrome (98.0.4758.102) at the time of browsing.
