Gcore WAAP protects your web application by blocking traffic from well-known malicious IP addresses. 

We constantly collect, update, and validate these IP addresses, adding malicious IPs to the blocklist. This allows you to block, challenge, or allow traffic from highly suspected entities. 

<Info>
**Info**

This policy group is available in the [Pro](/waap/billing#pro) and [Enterprise](/waap/billing#enterprise) plans.
</Info>

## Configure policy group

You can review the IP reputation policy group and enable or disable its policies in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard): 

1\. Navigate to **WAAP** > **Domains**. 


<Frame>![Domains page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/waap/waap-policies/domains-waap-page.png)</Frame>



2\. Find the domain where you want to configure the policy group and click the domain name to open it. 

3\. On the **Policies** page that opens, click **IP reputation** to expand the section and adjust the policies.

### Traffic via TOR network

TOR nodes are commonly used for web anonymity, but can also be used by hackers, scrapers, and spammers to crawl and hack web applications. 

Enabling this policy will block traffic from IP addresses associated with the TOR network.

### Traffic via proxy networks

Proxy networks are commonly used for web anonymity, but can also be used by hackers, scrapers, and spammers to crawl and hack web applications. 

Use JavaScript validation to verify traffic from known proxy networks. This provides enhanced visibility and security against potential risks associated with proxy usage within web applications. 

### Traffic from hosting services

Organic human traffic is unlikely to come from IP spaces belonging to hosting providers. Instead, this traffic typically comes from infected servers controlled by hackers. 

Use JavaScript validation to verify traffic from hosting services and commercial cloud providers. This enhances your application security by mitigating potential risks associated with such services within web applications. 

### Traffic via VPNs

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are commonly used for web anonymity, but can also be used by hackers, scrapers, and spammers to crawl and hack web applications. 

Validate traffic originating from VPNs using JavaScript. This provides increased visibility and security against potential risks associated with VPN usage within web applications. 

### Bot traffic

Use JavaScript validation to verify traffic coming from IP addresses associated with malicious automated agents (bots). 

### Traffic from suspicious NAT ranges

Validate traffic coming from high-risk NAT ranges using JavaScript. These ranges are calculated based on historical web behavior detected by a machine learning classifier. 

### External reputation block list

The IPs on this list are known to be malicious or spam. When an IP with a negative reputation is detected, validate the incoming traffic using JavaScript. 

### Traffic via CDNs

Organic human traffic is unlikely to originate from IP spaces belonging to CDN companies. When such traffic is detected, validate it using JavaScript.
