The Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) includes a Behavioral WAF policy group that helps prevent malicious attacks on your websites. The policy group contains a set of sophisticated user behavior and reputation analysis policies that inspect traffic and defend your website against threats such as spamming or brute force attacks.

### Anti-spam

Use CAPTCHA and JavaScript validation when user activity during a session suggests aggressive use of forms to, for instance, generate new accounts or post spam content. 

### Probing and forced browsing

Use CAPTCHA and JavaScript validation to challenge brute-forced requests on random URLs, which might aim to discover your web application's structure and hidden directories. Requests that fail to pass the validation will be blocked. 

### Obfuscated attacks and zero-day mitigation

Block clients that perform multiple injection attacks. 

### Repeated violations

Present with CAPTCHA or block those clients that failed to answer a previously displayed challenge. Requests that fail to pass the validation will be blocked. 

### Brute-force protection

Present users with CAPTCHA when there's an attempt to guess usernames and passwords on web login forms. If the client fails to pass the validation after a few attempts, the request will be blocked.
