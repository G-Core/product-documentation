The WAF & OWASP Top 10 policy group contains a robust set of policies that protect your application against the most critical security risks standardized by the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/). 

Some policies in this policy group also block the response phase of a request to prevent data leakage. For example, the Personally identifiable information (PII) policy can block a response if personal or private information is detected. In such cases, the request will return a status code **200 OK**, but the response will be blocked. 

## Configure policy group

You can review the WAF and OWASP top threats policy group and enable or disable its policies in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard): 

1\. Navigate to **WAAP** > **Domains**. 


<Frame>![Domains page in the Customer Portal](/images/docs/waap/waap-policies/domains-waap-page.png)</Frame>



2\. Find the domain where you want to configure the policy group and click the domain name to open it. 

3\. On the **Policies** page that opens, click **WAF and OWASP top threats** to expand the section and adjust the policies.

The following table features the full list of policies that you can configure as part of the WAF & OWASP top threats policy group. These policies correspond to the most common types of threats. 

| Policy                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SQL injection**              | In this form of attack, hackers use malicious SQL code to manipulate the backend of a database and access sensitive information such as company data, user lists, or private customer details. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to detect and block any attempts to alter database queries.                                    |
| **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** | XSS attacks happen when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code to a different user. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to detect and prevent XSS attacks by analyzing incoming requests for malicious script injections and blocking the execution of such scripts.                                      |
| **Shellshock exploit**         | This is a Bash shell vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code and potentially harmful commands. <br/> <br/> By enabling the policy, you protect your application against malicious attempts to inject unauthorized commands into Bash environments.                                |
| **Remote file inclusion**     | This attack exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that dynamically reference external scripts. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to protect against unauthorized inclusion of remote files.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Apache Struts exploit**      | Apache Struts v1 contains a vulnerability that allows malicious users to exploit the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL). <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to safeguard your web application against malicious exploits that target vulnerabilities in the Apache framework.                                    |
| **Local file inclusion**      | Some attackers can exploit vulnerable inclusion procedures in a web application by injecting files that already exist on a server. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to defend against the unauthorized inclusion of local files.                                                                                                                        |
| **Common web application vulnerabilities** | Enable the policy to protect your application against a range of prevalent web vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Web shell execution prevention** | Malicious scripts are often used to escalate and maintain persistent access to compromised web applications. This is a common post-exploitation attack. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to block any attempts to execute web shell scripts and to gain unauthorized access to your application.                      |
| **Protocol attack**            | These types of attacks are designed to eat up the processing capacity of a network infrastructure resource like a server, firewall, or load balancer. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to block any attempts to inject and manipulate headers or query parameters through sanitation of insufficient user input.              |
| **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)** | CSRF is an attack that exploits a vulnerability in a web application. This happens if the application can’t differentiate between a request generated by an individual user and a request initiated without their consent. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to prevent such attacks and ensure the integrity of user interactions with your application. |
| **Open redirect**              | This vulnerability occurs when attackers exploit unfiltered or unvalidated redirect destinations provided by a client. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to defend against unauthorized and potentially malicious URL redirects.                                                                                                                    |
| **Shell injection**            | This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server running an application. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to block malicious attempts to inject unauthorized commands into web application shells.                                                                      |
| **Code injection**             | This attack involves injecting malicious code that is interpreted or executed by the application. This is usually possible due to a lack of proper input and output validation. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to prevent any attempts to inject unauthorized code or commands into web applications.                   |
| **Sensitive data exposure**    | These attacks target sensitive data, aiming to expose critical information about the company, its customers, or its users. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to protect against the accidental exposure of application-related data.                                                                                                                    |
| **XML External Entity (XXE)**  | This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to ensure the security and integrity of your XML-based data.                                                                                                                           |
| **Personally identifiable information** | When personally identifiable information (PII) isn’t properly protected, it can cause a security vulnerability and lead to data leakage. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to prevent accidental exposure of personal data by searching for private information in the web application responses.                |
| **Server-side template injection** | Some attackers can use native template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template and then execute it on the server. <br/> <br/> Enable the policy to block attempts to inject unauthorized code into your web application templates.                                                                           |
