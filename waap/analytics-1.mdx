2. Find the domain where you want to check analytics and click the domain name to open it. You'll be directed to the **Overview** page.

The data is displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and is available on the following pages, accessible from the left menu:

- **Overview**: Get a consolidated view of all incoming requests that have been inspected by WAAP.
- **Events**: View detailed statistics on the incoming requests and the actions enforced for those requests.
- **L7 DDoS**: Check for recent attacks and get detailed information about each of them.

  After you enable WAAP protection for your CDN resource, it might take up to 20 minutes to populate your domain with real data and apply all system-wide settings.
