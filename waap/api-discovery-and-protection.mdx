API endpoints may expose sensitive data or functionality that's not accessible through the web interface, making them potential targets for attackers. 

To ensure that your domain is fully protected with Gcore WAAP, extend your web security with advanced API protection settings: 

  * **API Discovery** : set up automated detection of potential APIs; add and manage existing endpoints. 

  * **API base path** : configure API protection by manually specifying the base paths of your API endpoints.

  * **Configure API access with reserved tags** : group APIs by access level and determine which user roles are permitted to access each group.
