title: "Security insights"

This feature provides enhanced visibility into potential security threats for your domain.  

Security Insights are system-generated notifications that contain information about potential risks, such as domain misconfigurations, rule mismanagement, or security vulnerabilities.  

Each Insight is paired with a recommendation to resolve the issue alerted in the insight and mitigate the potential vulnerability.

  This feature is available in the [<u>Enterprise package</u>](https://gcorelu.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/technical_writers/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB1815DC7-5466-4D18-A09B-36D928B69808%7D&file=Billing.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) .

## View security insights 

It is possible to view and manage system-generated Insights and related recommendations in the Customer Portal on the **Security Insights** page.

To view the insights, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Gcore Customer Portal** and navigate to **WAAP \>** **Domains**.

3. Click a domain name. 
4. Click **Security Insights**. 

<Frame>
  ![Security Insights menu](/images/docs/waap/security-insights/security-insights-menu.png)
</Frame>

This will open the **Security Insights** dialog that shows a list of active insights.

When you select an insight, you can check the following information: 

- The high-level description of the issue.
- The recommended mitigation for the issue.
- The relevant identifier:
  - For **Allowed high risk IP**, the IP address associated with the high-risk requests.
  - For **Attack on disabled policy**, the Policy ID of the disabled WAAP policy that was targeted.
- The first time the issue was detected.
- The last time the issue was detected.

### Insight types

There are two types of security insights:

1. **Attack on disabled policy**: an attack targets a disabled [<u>WAF policy</u>](https://gcorelu.sharepoint.com/sites/technical_writers/Product%20Documentation/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Ftechnical%5Fwriters%2FProduct%20Documentation%2FOksana%20Levchuk%2FStackPath%20docs%2FWeb%20security%20%28new%20Gcore%20documentation%29%2FWAF%20policies&viewid=ec9231c7%2D2cb2%2D4025%2Db6ec%2D9b01525ae651) . This Insight allows you to reassess your policy rules and enable the ones that will protect your domain from similar attacks.  
2. **Allowed high-risk IP**: requests from high-risk IP addresses are being received, associated with malicious activities that are allowed due to user-created rules (for example, a Firewall rule or a Custom rule with the IP condition). This insight lets you adjust your WAAP settings to block those addresses or modify the relevant custom rules.  

You can filter for each type with the **Select insights** dropdown.

### Insight status  

Insights can have one of three statuses:

1. **Unread**: a new insight that has not been reviewed yet.  
2. **Read:** an insight that has been reviewed but was not closed.  
3. **Closed:** insight that has been reviewed and closed. 

An orange dot marks unread insights in the list of all insights.

### Silence insights  

You can silence an insight if you viewed it but don’t want to take its recommended action or close it. Silencing an insight means pausing all notifications for a specific period (e.g., a week, month, custom period, or indefinitely).  

You can silence an insight in 3 ways:

1. For a specific high-risk IP address **allowed by any rule**.
2. For a particular high-risk IP address **allowed by a specific rule**.
3. For **all high-risk IP addresses**.

To silence an insight, follow these steps:

1. Select it in the **Security Insights** view list.

<Frame>
  ![Select the security insight](/images/docs/waap/security-insights/select-insight.png)
</Frame>

2. Click the **Silence** button in its details.

<Frame>

3. Select the relevant silence rule and the duration for which you don’t want to receive notifications.

1. In the **Status** dropdown, select **Closed**.
