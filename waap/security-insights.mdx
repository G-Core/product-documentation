title: "Security Insights"

This feature provides enhanced visibility into potential security threats for your domain.  

Security Insights are system-generated notifications that contain information about potential risks, such as domain misconfigurations, rule mismanagement, or security vulnerabilities.  

Each Insight includes a recommendation to resolve the identified issue. This helps mitigate the potential vulnerability.

<Info>
  **Info**

  This feature is available in the **Enterprise** plan. To enable it for a domain, contact our [sales team](https://gcore.com/waap-contact-sales).

## View security Insights 

It is possible to view and manage system-generated Insights and related recommendations in the Customer Portal on the **Security Insights** page.

To view the insights, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Gcore Customer Portal** and navigate to **WAAP** > **Security Insights**.

2. In the domain dropdown at the top of the page, select the needed domain.

This will open the **Security Insights** page that shows a list of active insights.

When an insight is selected, the following information is available: 

- The high-level description of the issue.
- The recommended mitigation for the issue.
- The relevant identifier:
  - For **Allowed high risk IP**, the IP address associated with the high-risk requests.
  - For **Attack on disabled policy**, the Policy ID of the disabled WAAP policy that was targeted.
- The first time the issue was detected.
- The last time the issue was detected.

### Insight types

There are two types of Security Insights:

1. **Attack on disabled policy**: an attack targets a disabled [<u>WAAP policy</u>](https://gcore.com/docs/waap/waap-policies) . This Insight allows reassessment of policy rules and enables protection of the domain from similar attacks.
2. **Allowed high-risk IP**: requests from high-risk IP addresses are being received, associated with malicious activities that are allowed due to user-created rules (for example, a Firewall rule or a Custom rule with the IP condition). This insight allows adjusting WAAP settings to block those addresses or modify the relevant custom rules.

Use the **Select insights** dropdown to filter insights by type.

### Insight status  

Insights can have one of three statuses:

1. **Unread**: a new insight that has not been reviewed yet.  
2. **Read:** an insight that has been reviewed but was not closed.  
3. **Closed:** insight that has been reviewed and closed. 

An orange dot marks unread insights in the list of all insights.

### Silence insights  

An insight can be silenced if it has been viewed, but no action is taken, or it is not closed. Silencing an insight means pausing all notifications for a specific period (e.g., a week, month, custom period, or indefinitely).  

An insight can be silenced in three ways:

1. For a specific high-risk IP address **allowed by any rule**.
2. For a particular high-risk IP address **allowed by a specific rule**.
3. For **all high-risk IP addresses**.

To silence an insight, follow these steps:

1. Select it in the **Security Insights** view list.
