title: "Security Insights"
---

This feature provides you with enhanced visibility into potential security threats for your domain.  

Security Insights are system-generated notifications that contain information about potential risks, such as domain misconfigurations, rule mismanagement, or security vulnerabilities.  

Each Insight is paired with a recommendation to resolve the issue alerted in the insight and mitigate the potential vulnerability. 

Info: This feature is available in the [<u>Enterprise package</u>](https://gcorelu.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/technical_writers/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB1815DC7-5466-4D18-A09B-36D928B69808%7D&file=Billing.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) . To enable it for your domain, <u>contact our support team</u>.

This will open the **Security Insights** dialog that shows a list of active insights.

When you select an insight, you can check the following information: 

- The high-level description of the issue.
- The recommended mitigation for the issue.
- The IP address of the requests related to the issue.
- The first time the issue was detected.
- The last time the issue was detected.

Our <u>Security Insights Glossary</u> provides further details on the fields associated with each insight type. As our list of security insights is ever-expanding, refer to the glossary for a full, up-to-date accounting of all Security Insight types. 

### Insight types

There are two types of security insights:

1. **Attack on disabled policy**: an attack targets a disabled [<u>WAF policy</u>](https://gcorelu.sharepoint.com/sites/technical_writers/Product%20Documentation/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Ftechnical%5Fwriters%2FProduct%20Documentation%2FOksana%20Levchuk%2FStackPath%20docs%2FWeb%20security%20%28new%20Gcore%20documentation%29%2FWAF%20policies&viewid=ec9231c7%2D2cb2%2D4025%2Db6ec%2D9b01525ae651) . This Insight allows you to reassess your policy rules and enable the ones that will protect your domain from similar attacks.  
2. **Allowed high-risk IP**: you’re receiving requests from high-risk IP addresses associated with malicious activities. This insight lets you adjust your WAAP settings to block those addresses or modify relevant custom rules.  

You can filter for each type with the **Select insights** dropdown.

### Mark insights as read

After you view an insight, it’s marked as read. However, you can keep it unread as a reminder to act or check on it later.

Select the insight you want to mark as unread in the **Security Insights** list.
