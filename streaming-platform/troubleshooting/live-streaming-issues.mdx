# Live Streaming issues

Common issues you may encounter when working with Live Streaming, as well as steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

## Low latency mode has a delay of more than 5 seconds

_Possible cause_: The player does not support the DASH.JS library.  
_Suggested solution_: Our low latency solution has a latency of 4-5 seconds. If the delay is more than 5 seconds:

-   Make sure that the player supports the DASH.JS library.
-   Try testing your low latency stream at the open source <a href="https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js" target="_blank">DASH.JS player</a>.

## Current broadcast contains DVR chunks of the previous broadcast

_Possible cause_: The broadcast is over, but the stream has not been stopped.  
_Suggested solution_: This is a normal behavior.

To avoid this situation:

-   Stop the stream when the broadcast is finished.
-   Delete the DVR archive before starting a new broadcast.
