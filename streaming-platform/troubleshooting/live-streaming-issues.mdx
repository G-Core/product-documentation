# Live Streaming issues

Here are some common issues you may encounter when working with Live Streaming and steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

## Low-latency mode has a delay of more than 5 seconds

_Possible cause_: The player does not support the DASH.JS library.\
_Suggested solution_: Our low-latency solution has a 4-5-second latency. If the delay is more than 5 seconds:

- Make sure that the player supports the DASH.JS library.
- Try testing your low-latency stream at the open-source [DASH.JS player](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js).

## Current broadcast contains DVR chunks of the previous broadcast

_Possible cause_: The broadcast is over, but the stream has not been stopped.\
_Suggested solution_: This is a normal behavior.

To avoid this situation:

- Stop the stream when the broadcast is finished.
- Delete the DVR archive before starting a new broadcast.
