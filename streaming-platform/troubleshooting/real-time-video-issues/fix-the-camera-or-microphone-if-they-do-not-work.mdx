## Clear cache and cookies

If you're experiencing difficulties with video and audio delivery, it could be due to an outdated cookie file that's allowing other applications to use the camera and microphone instead of Real-Time Video.

We recommend clearing the cache and cookies for the entire browser and restarting your computer using the appropriate instructions for your browser: [Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en), [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09#:~:text=Select%20Settings%20%3E%20Privacy%2C%20search%2C,and%20then%20select%20Clear%20now.), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://opera.com/ru/use-cases/clean-browser-and-remove-trackers#:~:text=and%20site%20data-,Press%20Ctrl%2BShift%2BDel%20to%20open%20your%20Clear%20browsing%20data,Security%20and%20click%20Site%20settings.), [Safari (Mac)](https://support.apple.com/en-am/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), or [Safari (iOS)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265).

## Check the installed browser extensions

Third-party extensions installed in your browser could also be causing problems with the camera and microphone on some websites. To ensure that extensions aren't blocking Real-Time Video's access to the camera and microphone, open `meet.gcore.com` in incognito or private browser mode. This will allow you to run the website without any extensions impacting it. If the website works correctly in this mode, issues with the camera or microphone were likely caused by one of the installed extensions.

Please note that there is no quick way to determine which extension is causing the issue. To solve the problem, it is recommended that you disable each installed extension one by one to determine which one is causing the trouble. Once you've identified the problematic extension, you can disable it each time you use Real-Time Video.

## Inspect the firewall settings

If you're experiencing firewall restrictions, it's possible that some browsers won't be able to connect through strict networks or firewalls (such as when you're calling through a corporate network). In this case, it's best to use a different browser to solve the issue.

## Check the camera and microphone settings in your OS

Your browser may have been mistakenly blocked from accessing the camera or microphone. To check and allow your browser to access these devices, follow these steps:

### MacOS

1\. Open **System Preferences** and go to the "Security & Privacy" section. 


<Frame>![System Preferences iOS](/images/docs/streaming-platform/troubleshooting/real-time-video-issues/fix-the-camera-or-microphone-if-they-do-not-work/13081820659857.png)</Frame>



2\. Select "Camera" or "Microphone" from the list of options, then go to the **Privacy** section and check the boxes next to your browser to allow access.

Finally, restart the browser for the changes to take effect.

### Windows

If you're using Windows 11, you can set the default microphone at the system level or check the microphone or camera access.

To set up the default microphone, go to the "System" settings and select the **Sound** section. In the Input settings section, choose the desired input device.

To check and configure access to your microphone and camera, go to the "Privacy & Security" settings and select the **Camera** or **Microphone** sections. Ensure that your browser has permission to use the camera or microphone.
