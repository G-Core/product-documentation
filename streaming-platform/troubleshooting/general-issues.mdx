Common issues you may encounter when working with both Live and VOD streams, as well as steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

<Tip>
  If you encounter problems specific to live streaming or VOD uploads, please refer to the [Live streaming issues](https://gcore.com/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/troubleshooting/live-streaming-issues) or [VOD issues](https://gcore.com/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/troubleshooting/vod-issues) pages.

## General troubleshooting steps

For the most common issues, such as video not playing, taking a long time to start streaming, or looking blurry, these basic checks should help:

- **Status page**: Check if the issue you are experiencing is related to any known issue or is an isolated one by visiting the [status page](https://status.gcore.com).
- **Source video**: Ensure that the source content is uploaded for streaming. If the same issue occurs in the source, re-upload the video or restart the stream.
- **Stream URL and code**: Use the exact URL and embed code that appear in the Streaming settings.
- **Streaming settings**: Make sure the stream is enabled. If configured to pull a stream, ensure the source URL is correct.
- **Encoder settings**: Make sure you are using the recommended settings. If configured to push a stream, ensure the server URL and stream key are accurate.

Other things to try:

- Clear the browsing data.
- Disable any interfering browser extensions.
- Ensure that the network connection is stable. Try connecting with or without a VPN.
- Verify that the streaming ports are open on the firewall.
- Update the browser or device OS.

## Common playback issues

Various factors, including network issues, device compatibility, and encoding settings, can cause playback issues. Here are some common problems and their solutions.

### Stream does not appear on some devices

_Possible cause_: Device is too old.\
_Suggested solution_: Streaming should work on most devices, but some may not be compatible. Try using a modern device with enough processing power and memory to stream video successfully.

### Stream returns an HTTP 404 error

_Possible cause_: Transcoding is in progress.\
_Suggested solution_: Each video chunk may take several seconds to transcode. Allow 10 to 15 seconds for this to happen. Once the chunks have been transcoded, the stream should be ready to play.

_Possible cause_: Low Latency is not enabled in the Customer Portal.\
_Suggested solution_: Contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to activate this option.

<Tip>
  For more details on HTTP status codes, see the [HTTP status codes page](https://gcore.com/docs/streaming-platform/troubleshooting/http-status-codes).

### Stream returns an HTTP 502 error
