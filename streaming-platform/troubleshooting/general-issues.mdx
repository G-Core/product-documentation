Common issues you may encounter when working with both Live and VOD streams, as well as steps you can take to troubleshoot them.

<Tip>
  If you encounter problems specific to live streaming or VOD uploads, please refer to the [Live streaming issues](live-streaming-issues) or [VOD issues](vod-issues) pages.

## General troubleshooting steps

For the most common issues, such as video not playing, taking a long time to start streaming, or looking blurry, these basic checks should help:

- **Status page**: Check if the issue you are experiencing is related to any known issue or is an isolated one by visiting the [status page](https://status.gcore.com).
- **Source video**: Ensure that the source content is uploaded for streaming. If the same issue occurs in the source, re-upload the video or restart the stream.
- **Stream URL and code**: Use the exact URL and embed code that appear in the Streaming settings.
- **Streaming settings**: Make sure the stream is enabled. If configured to pull a stream, ensure the source URL is correct.
- **Encoder settings**: Make sure you are using the recommended settings. If configured to push a stream, ensure the server URL and stream key are accurate.

Other things to try:

- Clear the browsing data.
- Disable any interfering browser extensions.
- Ensure that the network connection is stable. Try connecting with or without a VPN.
- Verify that the streaming ports are open on the firewall.
- Update the browser or device OS.

## Common playback issues

Various factors, including network issues, device compatibility, and encoding settings, can cause playback issues. Here are some common problems and their solutions.

### Stream does not appear on some devices

_Possible cause_: Device is too old.\
_Suggested solution_: Streaming should work on most devices, but some may not be compatible. Try using a modern device with enough processing power and memory to stream video successfully.


### Stream does not played on SmartTV

Samsung Tizen and Orsay, as well as LG WebOS and NetCast, and other SmartTV platforms are very limited in performance and hardware, so often some functions may not work as well as on other regular platforms such as PCs and mobiles.

**Low-latency:**
Firstly, low-latency is not suitable for most old models. Use classic HLS MPEG-TS.

**Let's Encrypt certificate:**
By default CDN resources are created using the Let's Encrypt certificate. But not all TVs accept it. Therefore, for broadcasting, create your own certificate and upload it to the appropriate CDN resource.

**MPEG-DASH:**
Our tests with the two DASH templates showed that the number-based SegmentTemplate is not reliable for live streaming on Smart TVs. Over long playback (days of unstoppable play), the encoder and transmuxer clocks can drift, causing playback errors – players request segments that no longer align, and the transmuxer requires a restart.
We offer recommended solution for that case — .mpd manifests use time-based SegmentTimeline template, which avoids drift issues and ensures stable live playback.


### Stream returns an HTTP 404 error

_Possible cause_: Transcoding is in progress.\
_Suggested solution_: Each video chunk may take several seconds to transcode. Allow 10 to 15 seconds for this to happen. Once the chunks have been transcoded, the stream should be ready to play.

_Possible cause_: Low Latency is not enabled in the Customer Portal.\
_Suggested solution_: Contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to activate this option.

</Tip>

### Stream returns an HTTP 502 error

_Possible cause_: CDN resource settings have been changed from the preset settings.\
_Suggested solution_: Contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to assist you in restoring the settings.

_Possible cause_: Token configuration is not synchronized.\
_Suggested solution_: Contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) to help you restore the settings.
