## How does our Video Streaming distribute video content?

Our [Video Streaming](https://gcore.com/streaming-platform) distributes video content through the Gcore CDN network. Edge servers pull videos from storage or live streams from the media server and deliver them quickly to end users.

## From which subdomain is your content distributed?

Content is distributed to viewers from a CDN resource subdomain name. When you create an account and activate the Video Streaming, we create a subdomain in the format:

```sh
clientID.gvideo.io
 ```

The _clientID_ is a unique identifier for your account, which can be found in the [General](https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/company) section under the "Client ID" field. For example, if your clientID is _12345_ , the subdomain for the Video Streaming will be _12345.gvideo.io_. 

This subdomain is included in the URLs of all your videos or live streams uploaded to the Video Streaming, such as `https://12345.gvideo.io/cmaf/12345_00000/master.m3u8` (a link to a live stream) or `https://12345.gvideo.io/videos/12345_ABcdefg123HiJ` (a link to a VoD).

## Change the default subdomain

If you want to change the default subdomain to set a custom domain name, configure geo-restrictions, or implement other settings, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com) or your personal manager.
