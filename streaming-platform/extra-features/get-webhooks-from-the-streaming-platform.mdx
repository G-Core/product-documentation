sidebarTitle: Webhooks

A webhook is a free automated notification about an event in our service. You can receive notifications about the following events of our Video Streaming:

  * A live stream has started or finished.
  * Recording of a live stream has started or paused.
  * Updates on processing of a live stream recording: a recording has started processing, partially processed, or completely processed.
  * Updates on broadcast statuses: pending, live, paused, or finished.
  * A video is uploaded to the Gcore Customer Portal.
  * Updates on video processing: a video has started processing, partially processed, or completely processed.
  * Updates to a restream: it was created, is live, or was stopped.



Whenever any of these events happens, our server will create an HTTP POST request and notify you about it. You will receive the information in JSON format. Below is an example of a webhook triggered when a live stream starts.

```json
{   
    "type": "stream",   
     "message": {   
           "stream": {   
             "id": 12345,   
             "live": true,  
             "recording": false    
           }   
      }   
}
 ```

Customize the following values:

  * **12345** is the stream ID in the Gcore Customer Portal,
  * **true** is the indicator that the Video Streaming is receiving your stream,
  * **false** is the indicator that your stream is not being recorded.



## What are the video streaming webhooks used for?

Webhooks are used by apps integrated with the Video Streaming. You can configure your app so that it will activate automatic workflows whenever it receives a webhook.

For example, users share videos in your app. When a user adds a new video, it is uploaded and processed through our Video Streaming. Then you need to embed the video in your application. You set up the auto-posting: as soon as the video is processed, the Video Streaming will send a webhook, and your app will post the video.

## Configure the webhook integration

1\. Prepare your HTTP server to receive webhooks.

2\. Contact us via chat or email [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com) and ask to enable the webhook integration. Specify your ID (personal client ID) and the URL of the server that will receive webhooks. You can find your ID in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard).


<Frame>![your ID in the Gcore Customer Portal](/images/docs/streaming-platform/extra-features/get-webhooks-from-the-streaming-platform/image.png)</Frame>



The message template: _"Good afternoon! Please configure the Video Streaming webhook integration for my account with ID..... The URL of my server to send webhooks to is ...."_.

3\. We will notify you when we configure the webhook integration.

We deliver webhooks for free from the IP range  _92.223.123.0/24_.

We can send webhooks of one account only to one server. If your server is unavailable, undelivered webhooks won't be sent again. You will only receive a webhook of the next event.
