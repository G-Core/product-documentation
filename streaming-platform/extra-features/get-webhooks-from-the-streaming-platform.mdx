## Webhook types

A webhook is a real-time callback that sends an HTTP POST request to your server-side app when a defined event happens in our Video Streaming service. 
This way, you instantly receive updates and can trigger automated actions without manual checks by constant pulling API.

A single universal endpoint is used for all types of webhooks.

```json
{
  "type": "stream|video|video_delete|restream",
  "message": { ... } 
}
```

Supported entities:
	1. Live streams – `type: stream`
	2. VOD videos – `type: vod`
  4. VOD delete – `type: video_delete`
	3. Restreamings – `type: restream`


The webhook will contain main fields of the entity for which the event occurred. This allows you to not pull the API to get additional data each time.


## Webhooks for Live

When the state of a live stream changes, the system triggers a webhook with type `stream`. The payload contains a message.stream object with stream properties.

**Behaviour:**
  - A webhook is fired on key state changes, such as a stream going live or stopping.
  - The payload allows you to track whether a stream is active, its source, and related metadata.
  - Both PUSH and PULL origins are supported.

**Fields:**
| Field               | Type    | Description                                                                |
|---------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **id**              | int     | Unique identifier of the stream                                            |
| **live**            | bool    | `true` if the stream is currently active, `false` if it has stopped        |
| **backup_live**     | bool    | `true` if the backup source is currently active                            |
| **recording**       | bool    | `true` if the stream is being recorded                                     |
| **client_user_id**  | string  | Optional client-defined user ID, `null` if not provided                    |
| **client_entity_data** | string | Optional client metadata associated with the stream, `null` if not provided |
| **pull**            | bool    | `true` if the stream is pulled from an external origin, `false` if pushed  |
| **uri**             | string  | The source URI of the stream:                                              |
| **stream_source_type** | string | Type of the stream source: `rtmp`, `srt`, `webrtc`, `https`, etc         |

<Info>
  Stream segments become available in the CDN (and player) within ~2–5 seconds after the `type: stream (live=true)` webhook is issued.
  
  Read more in the article [Ingest & Backup](/streaming-platform/live-streaming/primary-backup#stream-availability).

**Example:**

Started stream:
```json
{
  "type": "stream",
  "message": {
    "stream": {
      "id": 1001,
      "live": true,
      "backup_live": false,
      "recording": false,
      "client_user_id": null,
      "client_entity_data": null,
      "pull": false,
      "uri": "srt://vp-push-ed1-srt.gvideo.co:5001?streamid=12345#aaabbbcccddd",
      "stream_source_type": "srt"
    }
  }
}
```

Stoped stream:
```json
{
  "type": "stream",
  "message": {
    "stream": {
      "id": 1002,
      "live": false,
      "backup_live": false,
      "recording": false,
      "client_user_id": null,

    }
  }
}
```


## Webhooks for VOD

### VOD create and update

A webhook with type `video` fires when a VOD file is created, processed, or becomes playable. Use the payload to track processing progress and available renditions.

**Behaviour:**
  - Sent on key status changes of a video: empty → pending → viewable → ready or error.  ￼
  - converted_videos[].status reflects per-rendition progress like processing or complete.  ￼

| **duration**         | int         | Duration of the video in milliseconds                                      |
| **stream_id**        | int \| null | StreamID if it was recorded from a Live stream, otherwise `null`           |
| **status**           | string      | Processing status of the video: `empty`, `pending`, `viewable`, `ready`, `error` |
| **converted_videos** | array       | List of transcoded renditions with details                                 |
| └─ **name**          | string      | Rendition label (e.g., `vod1080p`)                                         |

| └─ **mp4_url**       | string      | Direct URL for a rendition in MP4 fromat                                   |


See the statuses of VOD processing in API docs:
  - Video status processing – [status](/api-reference/streaming/videos/get-video#response-status)
  - Rendition status processing – [converted_videos/status](/api-reference/streaming/videos/get-video#response-converted-videos)

**Example:**

Video uploaded:
```json
{
  "type": "video",
  "message": {
    "video": {
      "id": 2001,
      "slug": "bJkptcIp9a5wrowz",
      "name": "football_videoplayback_720",
      "duration": 43989,
      "stream_id": null,
      "status": "empty",
      "converted_videos": []
    }
  }
}
```

Video becomes viewable (not all renditions are ready yet, but video can be watched by end-users already):
```json
{
  "type": "video",
  "message": {
    "video": {
      "id": 2001,
      "slug": "bJkptcIp9a5wrowz",

        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


### VOD delete

A webhook with type `video_delete` notify your system that a VOD entity was deleted so you can purge caches, revoke URLs, and clean metadata.

**Behaviour:**
  - Fired when a video is deleted via API or UI. 
  - Emitted once per deletion event.

**Fields:**

| Field          | Type        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    }
  }
}
```


## Webhooks for Restream

When a restream changes state (for example, starts or stops), the system sends a webhook with type `restream`. 
The payload contains a message.restream object.

**Behaviour:**
  - Fired whenever a restream goes live or stops.
  - Allows you to track the status of a specific restream linked to a live stream.

**Fields:**
| Field      | Type   | Description                                                        |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **id**     | int    | Unique identifier of the restream.                                 |
| **name**   | string | Human-readable name of the restream.                               |
| **stream_id** | int | ID of the source live stream that this restream is linked to.      |
| **live**   | bool   | `true` if the restream is currently active, `false` if it stopped. |


**Example:**

Restream starts:
```json
{
  "type": "restream",
  "message": {
    "restream": {
      "id": 3001,
      "name": "RTMP from Brodcast#1 to Youtube",
      "stream_id": 1001,
      "live": true
    }
  }
}
```

Restream stops:
```json
{
  "type": "restream",
  "message": {
    "restream": {
      "id": 3001,
      "name": "RTMP from Brodcast#1 to Youtube",
      "stream_id": 1001,
      "live": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Sending events

We deliver webhooks from IP addresses `92.223.112.0/24` and `92.223.123.0/24`. So put them into the whitelist.

Events are sent only once. If your server is unavailable, undelivered webhooks won't be sent again.


## How to enable webhooks

<Info>
At the moment, webhooks can only be set up with our help. Tell us your end-point and we will install it in your account.
</Info>

1\. Prepare your HTTP server to receive webhooks.

2\. Contact us via chat or email [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com) and ask to enable the webhook integration. Specify your ID (personal client ID) and the URL of the server that will receive webhooks. You can find your ID in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard).

<Frame>![your ID in the Gcore Customer Portal](/images/docs/streaming-platform/extra-features/get-webhooks-from-the-streaming-platform/image.png)</Frame>

The message template: _"Good afternoon! Please configure the Video Streaming webhook integration for my account with ID..... The URL of my server to send webhooks to is ...."_.

3\. We will notify you when we configure the webhook integration.


**Testing:**

Also you can easily create and inspect webhook requests using web site https://webhook.site. 
For example, the temporary link look like `https://webhook.site/56ce9331-4ec4-4fa1-bf23-4c4e14276f24` to capture and display incoming webhook payloads for debugging. Create your own and send it to us to set up.
