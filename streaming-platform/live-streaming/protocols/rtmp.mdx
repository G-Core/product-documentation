Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is the most common way to stream to video streaming platforms:
 - Used primarily for encoder → platform ingest, not for playback.
 - Default port: RTMP 1935 (TCP), RTMPS 443 (TCP).
 - Must be configured on your encoder with parameters provided in the [Input parameters](/docs/streaming-platform/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/input-parameters-and-codecs).

Gcore Live Streaming supports both RTMP and RTMPS. RTMPS wrapped in TLS for encrypted transport, which helps traverse restrictive firewalls.

<Info>
  RTMP only supports H.264 video + AAC audio; for other codecs (e.g. H.265/HEVC), use [use SRT](/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/protocols/srt) ingest.

  We plan to support H265/HVEC and other extensions from the Enhanced RTMP specification. Stay tuned for updates.

## PUSH streams

Use RTMP PUSH when the encoder itself can establish an outbound connection to our Streaming Platform. This is the best choice in situations like:
- Use software encoders like OBS, ffmpeg, etc,
- use hardware encoders like Elemental, Haivision, etc,
- and when you control the encoder, want the simplest workflow, and don’t want to maintain your own always-on origin server.

Your encoder settings should contain the exact ingest parameters: server URL, backup URL (if used), stream key. Read below how to get ingest links.

To use RTMPS, just manually change the protocol name from "rtmp://" to "rtmps://".

Ingest link is looks like rtmp://vp-push-ed1.gvideo.co/in/12345?aaabbbcccddd and contains:
- protocol rtmp:// or rtmps://
- name of a specific server located in a specific geographic location – vp-push-ed1 is located in Europe
- exact stream key

*Example:*
That ffmpeg command will generate a test video (1280×720 @30fps color bars) with a 2kHz sine-tone audio track, encode them to H.264 video + AAC audio, and push the stream in FLV format over RTMP to the specified ingest URL.
```sh
ffmpeg -re -f lavfi -i testsrc2=size=1280x720:rate=30 \
       -f lavfi -i sine=f=2000:r=48000 \
       -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 1M -g 30 \
       -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 48000 \
       -f flv "rtmp://vp-push-ed1.gvideo.co/in/12345?aaabbbcccddd"
```

<Info>
If the stream is experiencing transcoding or playback problems, then perhaps changing the ingest server to another location will solve the problem. Read more in the [Geo Distributed Ingest Points](/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/primary-backup.mdx) section, and contact our support to change the ingest server location.

### Obtain the server URLs and stream key

There are two ways to obtain the server URLs and stream key: Customer Portal UI or API.

#### Customer Portal UI

1. In the **Gcore Customer Portal**, navigate to **Streaming** \> [**Live Streaming**](https://portal.gcore.com/streaming/streaming/list).

![List of live streams](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream/live-stream-list.png)

2. Click on the stream you want to push to. This will open the **Live Stream Settings**.

![Live stream settings](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream/live-stream-settings.png)

3. Ensure that the **Ingest type** is set to **Push**.
4. Ensure that the protocol is set to **RTMP** or **RTMPS** in the **URLs for encoder** section. 5. Copy the **Server** URL and **Stream Key** from the **URLs for encoder** section.

![URLs for encoder section](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream/urls-for-encoder.png)

#### API

You can also obtain the URL and stream key via the Gcore API. The endpoint returns the complete URLs for the default and backup ingest points and the stream key.

Example of the API request:

```http
GET /streaming/streams/{stream_id}
```

Example of the API response:

```json
{
  "push_url": "rtmp://vp-push-anx2.domain.com/in/123?08cd54f0",
  "backup_push_url": "rtmp://vp-push-ed1.domain.com/in/123b?08cd54f0",
  ...
}
```

Read more in [API documentation](/docs/api-reference/streaming/streams/create-live-stream).

## PULL streams

Gcore Video Streaming can PULL video data from your origin.

Main rules of pulling:
- The URL of the stream to pull from must be **publicly available** and **return data** for all requests.
- If you need to set an allowlist for access to the stream, please contact support to get an up-to-date list of networks.

### Setting up a PULL stream

There are two ways to set up a pull stream: via the Gcore Customer Portal or via the API.

#### Customer Portal UI

1. In the **Gcore Customer Portal**, navigate to **Streaming** \> [**Live Streaming**](https://portal.gcore.com/streaming/streaming/list).

![List of live streams](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream/live-stream-list.png)

2. Click on the stream you want to pull from. This will open the **Live Stream Settings**.

![Live stream settings](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/streaming-platform/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream/live-stream-settings.png)

3. Ensure that the **Ingest type** is set to **Pull**.
4. In the **URL** field, insert a link to the stream from your media server.
5. Click the **Save changes** button on the top right.

#### API

You can also set up a pull stream via the Gcore API. The endpoint accepts the URL of the stream to pull from.

Example of the API request:

```http
PATCH /streaming/streams/{stream_id}
```

```json
{
  "stream": {
    "pull": true,
    "uri": "rtmp://example.com/path/to/stream",
    ...
  }
}
```
