The sport detection content moderation task identifies various sporting activities in a video. This can include detecting specific types, actions, events, and moments. 

The check returns information about the object identified, video frame number where it was found, and probability of the detected object. Objects with a probability of at least 30% are included in the response. 

For a full list of activities that can be detected with the sport detection check, read our [API documentation](/docs/api-reference/streaming/ai/create-ai-cm:sport-task).

2\. In the **Origin URL** field, enter the link to your MP4 video. You have two options: 

  * **Paste video origin URL** : If your video is stored externally, provide a URL to its location. Ensure that the video is accessible via HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
