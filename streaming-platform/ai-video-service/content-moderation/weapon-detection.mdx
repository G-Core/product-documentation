The weapon detection content moderation task identifies the presence of weapons in a video. 

The check returns information about the object identified, the number of video frames where it was found, and the probability of the detected object. Objects with a probability of at least 30% are included in the response. For a full list of activities that can be detected with the weapon check, read our [API documentation](https://api.gcore.com/docs/streaming?_gl=1*1rw278g*_gcl_au*MTM0OTcwMzMxMC4xNzE3MTQ0ODk3*_ga*OTkwMzM5NjM4LjE3MDkxMDg3OTU.*_ga_Y79HRL8RPR*MTcyMTI4NzExMi4xMjIuMS4xNzIxMjg3MjMzLjYwLjAuMA..#tag/AI/operation/post_ai_contentmoderation_weapon).
