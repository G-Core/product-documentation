The child pornography content moderation task detects child sexual abuse materials (CSAM). 

To identify this content, we first run the [soft nudity](/streaming-platform/ai-video-service/content-moderation/soft-nudity-detection) and [hard nudity detection](/streaming-platform/ai-video-service/content-moderation/soft-nudity-detection) tasks. If both methods indicate the presence of obscene content with the involvement of children (child's face) in a frame, then such a video is marked as obscene. Frames are designated by the age category of identified children. 

The check returns information with the number of the video frame in which the child's face was found and the child's age. Objects with a probability of at least 30% are included in the response. 

To run the child pornography detection check:

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **Streaming** > **AI**. The **AI tasks** page will open.

2\. In the **Origin URL** field, enter the link to your MP4 video. You have two options: 

  * **Paste video origin URL** : If your video is stored externally, provide a URL to its location. Ensure that the video is accessible via HTTP or HTTPS protocols. 

To check the example of correctly formatted URL, use the link under the field. It will autogenerate a sample URL and you can adjust your URL accordingly.
