## Supported parameters

Gcore Video Streaming supports:

  * Receiving live streams from [your server (PULL) or a dedicated publishing point (PUSH)](/streaming-platform/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream) using numerous protocols including RTMP(S) and SRT. All supported live protocols are listed in the table below. The stream is transcoded and sent with [adaptive streaming](/streaming-platform/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/output-parameters-after-transcoding-bitrate-frame-rate-and-codecs#output-parameters-after-transcoding) via CDN in HLS/MPEG-DASH (CMAF low latency) formats.
  * Videos uploaded in almost any format, from standard MP4 to 4K HDR Video, are first transcoded to get videos of lower quality. Then, they're sent with adaptive streaming via CDN in HLS format.

If the recommended parameters do not suit your stream (codecs, custom FPS, ProRes, High 4:4:4, Enhanced RTMP, etc.), write to us in the chat, send an email to [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com), or contact your manager to find the solution.

## Multiple ingesting points

For smoother and more reliable streaming, we offer entry servers in key regions including Luxembourg, Ashburn, Miami, and Singapore. By connecting your streaming equipment to the nearest upload server, you can minimize latency and improve performance before the stream is distributed globally through our CDN.

This feature is especially valuable if your streams originate from multiple locations worldwide. You can specify preferred upload servers and the number of streams per region. Our team will then configure your account to match your streaming setup.

[Reach out to our support team](https://gcore.com/contact-us) or your account manager for setup assistance or additional details.

## RTMP, RTMPS, and SRT for live streaming

  * RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting audio, video, and data over the Internet between a player and a server, supporting low-latency communication for real-time streaming.
  * RTMPS is a variation of RTMP but incorporates SSL usage.
  * RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is a communication protocol used to control servers that stream media content. RTSP uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) to deliver media streams.
  * SRT (Secure Reliable Transport) is an open-source video transport protocol for delivering high-quality, secure, low-latency video across unreliable networks.



You can use Push or Pull methods where applicable.
