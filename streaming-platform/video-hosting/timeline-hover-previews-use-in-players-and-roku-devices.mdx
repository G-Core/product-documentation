## What are timeline hover previews?

Timeline hover previews, or trick play, is an option that makes it easier to rewind and find a specific moment in a video. It shows users previews when they point their cursor to any specific point on the video's timeline. For example:


<Frame>![Timeline hover previews](/images/docs/streaming-platform/video-hosting/timeline-hover-previews-use-in-players-and-roku-devices/coffeerun8-optimized.gif)</Frame>



## What do the previews consist of?

In the [Gcore Streaming Platform](https://gcore.com/streaming-platform), we use time-based preview. During the transcoding process, the video is divided into equal segments, and screenshots are taken. These screenshots are called _tiles_.

All tiles are collected in a single arrayâ€” _storyboard_. A storyboard is a large JPEG image of tiles chronologically arranged one after another. Here is an example of the storyboard for Blender Studio's cartoon "Coffee Run":

**Note** : We create storyboards for all videos automatically. 

## Adding timeline hover previews to players

### Gcore player

Timeline hover previews are embedded into Gcore's Player by default, so previews are displayed automatically. For example:

For external players, previews are available in two ways: 

  * [WebVTT format](/streaming-platform/video-hosting/timeline-hover-previews-use-in-players-and-roku-devices#webvtt-format-in-api)
  * [Roku trick play](/streaming-platform/video-hosting/timeline-hover-previews-use-in-players-and-roku-devices#roku-trick-play)



### WebVTT format in API

The [Get video API request](/docs/api-reference/streaming/videos/get-video) returns information about the video, including two additional fields:

  * `sprite`: link to the storyboard, which contains the tiles
  * `sprite_vtt`: description of tiles in VTT format



Example:

`GET https://api.gcore.com/streaming/videos/{video_id}/`

```
"sprite": "https://demo-public.gvideo.io/static/videoplatform/sprites/2675/2474723_FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr.mp4_sprite.jpg", 

"sprite_vtt": "1 
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000 
FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr_sprite.jpg#xywh=0,0,100,42

...

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr_sprite.jpg#xywh=100,84,100,42
17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr_sprite.jpg#xywh=200,84,100,42
18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr_sprite.jpg#xywh=300,84,100,42
...
```

The VTT field structure is:

  * Tile number, e.g., `17`
  * Timing when a tile is displayed, e.g., `00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000`
  * The coordinates of the upper left corner and the size of the tile from a storyboard (format is "xywh"): `xywh=200,84,100,42`



**Note** : Tiles are read from left to right, top to bottom.

In the picture below, the 17th tile (third one from left, third from top) is highlighted in VTT format:

### Roku trick play

According to the [Roku specification](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/developer-program/media-playback/trick-mode/hls-and-dash.md), we can embed tiles directly in .m3u8 files. Here's the format for requesting a video master manifest with embedded tiles:

```sh
https://domain.com/videos/{client_id}_{video_id}/master[-img].m3u8 
```

Where:

  * `{client_id}`: your account ID
  * `{video_id}`: identifier of the video or live stream
  * `[-img]`: variable suffix, when specified, information about tiles is added to the manifest



You can use the result by adding the `[-img]` suffix. It will add a special preview tag to the master manifest `#EXT-X-IMAGE-STREAM-INF`, which points to an additional tiles manifest containing a link to a storyboard file, tile size, how often tiles should replace each other, and other information.

Example of a master manifest with the suffix for tiles:

```sh
curl https://demo-public.gvideo.io/videos/2675_FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr/master-img.m3u8
```

```sh
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=1928000,RESOLUTION=1720x720,FRAME-RATE=24.000,CODECS="avc1.640020,mp4a.40.2",VIDEO-RANGE=SDR
index-svod720n-v1-a1.m3u8
... 
#EXT-X-IMAGE-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=4200,RESOLUTION=100x42,CODECS=jpeg,URI=tiles.m3u8
```

Example of a tiles manifest:

```sh
curl https://demo-public.gvideo.io/videos/2675_FnlHXwA16ZMxmUr/tiles.m3u8 
```

```sh
#EXTM3U

#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1 
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
