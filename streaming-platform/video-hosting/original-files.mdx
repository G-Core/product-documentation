An original (video) file is a file you created when recording a video. In contrast to this original file, you can have multiple transcoded renditions with different video codecs or resolutions. These renditions are made from the original file, which forms the upper limit for the transcoding quality.

<Info>
  **Gcore Video Streaming deletes the uploaded original files** after the transcoding is completed, so don’t rely on it to back up your originals.
</Info>

When you upload an original video file to Gcore Video Streaming, it transcodes the file for [multiple codecs and resolutions](/streaming-platform/video-hosting/hls-and-mp4) to ensure viewers can watch it regardless of device performance, display resolution, or connection speed.


## Download transcoded files

While the original files aren’t available for download, you can get the transcoded files via the Gcore Customer Portal.


### Step 1. Open the Video Settings

You can find the video by navigating to **Gcore** **Customer Portal \> Streaming \> Video** **Hosting \> All Videos** and clicking on the video name to access the **Video Settings**.
