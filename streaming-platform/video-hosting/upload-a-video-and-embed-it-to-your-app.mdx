  * **iFrame embed code** : A URL to our HTML video player with the video inside. It can be inserted into an iframe on your website and the video will automatically play on all browsers.




In the Links for export section, you can also choose the video size and download the uploaded video in the required quality by selecting its bitrate and clicking **Download video**.
