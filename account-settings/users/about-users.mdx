title: About Users
---

In the Gcore Customer Portal, there are roles that define user rights, such as permitted actions to manage the [CDN](https://cdn.gcore.com) and [Video Streaming](https://streaming.gcore.com) and change personal data.

**Note**: The [Edge Cloud](https://cloud.gcore.com) service has its own role system. Read the "[User roles and rights](/cloud/getting-started/projects/users/user-roles-and-rights)" guide for more details. For other Gcore services ([Managed DNS](https://dns.gcore.com), [Object Storage](https://storage.gcore.com), [Web Application Security and DDoS Protection](https://control.gcore.com)), roles do not apply. This means that regardless of the user's role, they can perform any actions with the Managed DNS service.

By default, a user who registers an account has the "Administrator" role with the most extensive rights. An Administrator can invite up to five new users to their account daily and assign one of the available roles to each of them:

**Note**: Other CDN and Video Streaming actions not mentioned in the table are prohibited for roles.

If an administrator invites a new user and assigns two roles to them, the role with more rights will be valid. For example, users who are assigned Users and Engineers roles will possess Engineers rights.
