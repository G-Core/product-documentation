The response time of our support team depends on three parameters:

  1. Billing plan
  2. The request priority
  3. The workload of our support team



## Billing plan

Your billing plan determines how and when we can respond to your question. You can check your billing plan on the [Services](https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services) page by selecting a service.

Check what support is provided by your plan on the [Pricing](https://gcore.com/pricing/edge-network) page.

There are three support modes available:

  * **For free plans**, there is no technical support, meaning our support team cannot assist you. However, you can always find answers to your questions in our [Knowledge Base](). There are hundreds of articles describing how to configure our services and solve issues. 
  * **For "medium" plans** (e.g., "Start" CDN plan), we provide support during business hours on business days (8/5). 
  * **For PRO+ plans**, we provide round-the-clock support (24/7).



## The request priority

Support request handling and response times are determined by your Technical Support plan.

Each support plan includes predefined response times for different incident severity levels (P1–P4). These response times are fixed and cannot be changed per request.

To see the response times included in each plan, refer to the [Technical Support as a Service plans page](https://gcore.com/support-as-a-service#plans).
  
If you use CDN, Video Streaming, Edge Cloud, Web Application Protection, Object Storage, or Managed DNS, you can set the priority of the request and manage it in the "Help center" while creating a request. For other services, priority is indicated in the chat on our website.

To create a request, click **Help** and then **Help center**.

The new page will open. Specify the details of your request and set the "Priority" option.

This functionality will soon be available for Hosting clients.

When you send a request by email, it will have "Normal" priority by default. Please feel free to ask to change the priority by emailing our support team.

**Note**: We reserve the right to lower the priority if the issue is not caused by errors in our service, the priority needs to be corrected, or it does not meet our internal criteria.

## The workload of our support team

The support team's workload can affect the response time. If technical support is overloaded, the response time will be increased.

However, it rarely happens. We usually respond earlier than the established deadlines.
