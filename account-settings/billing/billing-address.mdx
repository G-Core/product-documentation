**Info**

Your billing address is separate from the address specified in your payment method. The changes made on one page won't impact the other.

## Tax location

The location is defined automatically based on the country you selected in the **General** section. 

It's important to select the correct country in your billing address as it will define the applicable tax laws and regulations.
