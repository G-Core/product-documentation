Your payment for Gcore products is based on either a pay-as-you-go basis (the actual resource consumption) or a fixed monthly cost associated with a particular product (commitment). Explore our [Pricing page](https://gcore.com/pricing) for detailed cost information.

## Payments

To view your payment history, click on the profile icon in the top-right corner and navigate to **Billing** \> **Payments**.

The Payments page shows payment operations that have been processed for your account. For each payment, you can check:

- **ID**: The unique identifier for a transaction.
- **Date**: The date when the transaction occurred.
- **Payment method**: How the payment was made (credit card, debit card, or PayPal).
- **Sum**: The total paid amount.
- **Status**: The current processing state of the transaction. Check the [Payment statuses](/account-settings/billing/payments#payment-statuses) section for details.

- **Paid**: The payment was successfully completed.
- **Unpaid**: The payment failed.
- **Cancelled**: The payment was cancelled.
- **Pending**: The payment is being processed.
- **Refunded**: The payment has been refunded.

  The payment method address is separate from your [billing address](/account-settings/account/overview). This means that any changes made on one page won't impact the other.

## Top-up

A manual top-up adds funds to the Gcore account balance and can be used to pay for Gcore services.

After the payment is completed successfully, the funds are added to the account balance.

## Set a default payment method

A default payment method is the primary payment option that is automatically selected for transactions unless you choose a different one.

You can add multiple payment methods. The first method you add will be set as the default, but you can change it at any time. To do so, click the three-dot icon next to the preferred payment method and select **Make default**.
