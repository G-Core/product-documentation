## Bonus credits

Bonus credits are special points credited to your account for a particular period of time. You can use them to pay for Gcore products. Bonuses are credited to a special bonus account by the decision of the company's management.

We convert bonuses at the following rate: **1 bonus = 1 unit of currency** used in your account. For example, $10 bonuses will equal 10 US dollars.

The **Bonus credits** table displays the following information:

  * **Sum**: The amount of bonus credits. Green values with "+" indicate credited bonuses, red values with "-" indicate charged bonuses.
  * **Expiration**: The date range during which the bonus credits are valid.

After successful activation, the bonus credits will appear in the Bonus credits table.

## Bonuses debiting

Bonuses are debited automatically as part of the payment for products:

  * If you are registered as an individual customer, the amount debited from the payment resource will be reduced by the number of bonus credits.
  * If you are registered as a company, the number of bonuses will be counted as a discount in your invoice.

<Warning>
**Warning**

As bonus credits reduce the taxable amount of expenses, the tax is also recalculated downward.
