Bonus credits are special points that are credited to your account for a particular period of time. You can use them to pay for our products. Bonuses are credited to a special bonus account by the decision of the company's management. 

We convert bonuses at the following rate: **1 bonus = 1 unit of currency** used in your personal account. For example, â‚¬ 50 bonuses will equal to 50 euros. 

## View your bonuses

## Bonuses debiting

Bonuses are debited automatically as a part of the payment for products: 

  * If you are registered as an individual customer, the amount debited from the payment resource will be reduced by the number of bonus credits. 
  * If you are registered as a company, the number of bonuses will be counted as a discount in your invoice.

<Warning>
**Warning**

As bonus credits reduce the taxable amount of expenses, the tax is also recalculated downward.
