title: Data deletion
---

## Grounds for product and data deletion

We delete a service, its settings, and associated customer data after the service is suspended. The duration depends on the product; scroll down for full details.

Products can be suspended in three cases:

1\. If you [disabled the product](/account-settings/billing/disable-and-resume-a-service#disable-services) manually. 2\. At the end of a [Base Trial](/account-settings/billing/trial-conditions), if you didn't enable a plan. 3\. After an unsuccessful payment charge attempt. If one of your products is suspended because of an unsuccessful payment attempt, all other products in your account are also suspended.

## When are services and data deleted after suspension?

After a service is suspended, we don't immediately delete it and its associated [customer data](/account-settings/billing/data-deletion#what-data-will-be-deleted). The period between suspension and deletion depends on the product.

After the product is suspended, some time passes before it will be deleted with all [customer data](/account-settings/billing/data-deletion#what-data-will-be-deleted). The period between suspension and deletion depends on the product.

**Warning**

All periods mentioned below are applied to all Gcore accounts by default. They can differ in particular cases if a personal manager or technical support changes the number of days for your account by mutual preliminary arrangement.

Additionally, Gcore reserves the right to delete data (including without prior notice) to enforce its rights as specified in the Master Services Agreement, other Gcore documentation, or applicable law.
