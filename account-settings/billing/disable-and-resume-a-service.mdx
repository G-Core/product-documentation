After disabling, the service will continue working until the date specified in the Customer Portal. Then, it will be suspended and no longer available. Upon suspension, the service and its data (associated resources and settings) will be deleted. After a [specified suspension period](/account-settings/billing/data-deletion), complete service deletion will occur.

## Resume services

Open the [Services](https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services) page, find the service you need, and click **Resume service** and confirm the action.
