## Per-user vs shared settings

Before configuring notifications, understand which settings affect only the current user and which apply to the entire account:

| Setting type | Scope | Behavior |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Important notifications | Per user | Each user controls their own toggles |
| Service notifications (Cloud, CDN, etc.) | Per user | Each user controls their own toggles |
| General notifications | Shared | Changes affect all users on the account |
| Consumption thresholds | Shared | Changes affect all users on the account |

<Warning>
When configuring shared settings, any changes immediately affect all users on the account. Coordinate with other users before modifying consumption thresholds or general notification preferences.
</Warning>

## Allow notifications

The **Allow notifications** checkbox at the top of the page controls all email notifications. When disabled, no notification emails are sent regardless of individual settings.

## Important notifications

Critical notifications about service availability and account status.

- **Service emails**: API change notifications and technical information that might affect service availability. All users are automatically subscribed.
- **Promotional emails**: Newsletters with tips and special offers. Enabled only if the checkbox was selected during account registration.

<Tip>
Gcore recommends keeping Service emails enabled to stay informed about changes that could affect service availability or require action.

## Object Storage notifications

Alerts for Object Storage usage and consumption thresholds.

<img src="/images/docs/account-settings/notifications-object-storage.png" alt="Object Storage notifications" width="80%"/>

| Notification | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Number of requests in storage (bucket) control | Sent when request count reaches the specified limit (counted from the first day of each month) |
| Number of objects in bucket control | Sent when object count in a bucket reaches the specified limit |

To configure a consumption threshold:

1. Enable the desired notification type.
2. Click **Add limit**.
3. Select the storage and, optionally, a specific bucket.
4. Enter the threshold value.
5. Click **Save**.

<Info>
Consumption thresholds are shared across all users on the account. For example, if User A sets the limit to 100 GB, User B and User C see the same value. If User C later changes it to 70 GB, all users receive notifications when consumption reaches the new threshold.
</Info>

### Configure CDN traffic consumption threshold

To receive notifications when CDN traffic reaches a specified limit:

1. Enable **CDN traffic consumption control**.
2. Enter the threshold value in the **Traffic consumption level** field (in GB).
3. Click **Save**.

Traffic consumption is counted from the first day of each month. If a zero value is specified, no notifications are sent.

<Info>
Traffic thresholds are shared across all users on the account. For example, if User A sets the limit to 100 GB, User B and User C see the same value. If User C later changes it to 70 GB, all users receive notifications when traffic reaches the new threshold.
</Info>

## Threshold timing

Consumption thresholds are checked on the following schedule:

| Service | Check frequency | Reset period |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| CDN traffic | Hourly (at :00 minutes, +/- 3 min) | Monthly (1st of month) |
| Object Storage requests | Continuous | Monthly (1st of month) |
| Object Storage objects | Continuous | None (absolute count) |

If a newly configured threshold is already exceeded, notifications are sent at the next scheduled check. For example, if 2 TB of traffic has already been consumed and the threshold is set to 1 TB at 12:21, all users on the account receive a notification at 13:00 when the next hourly check occurs.
