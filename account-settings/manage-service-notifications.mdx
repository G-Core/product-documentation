## Limitation notifications

Limitation notifications are available for CDN and Object Storage (bucket) services. 

Traffic or another counting starts on the first day of each month. The traffic volume is checked once an hour at 00 minutes (±3 minutes).

If you set a traffic consumption level that has already been exceeded, then after the next check all the account users will receive a notification. For example, you have already used 2TB of traffic, at 12:21 you turned on the traffic control option and set the traffic consumption level equal to 1TB, at 13:00 all the account users will get the notification.

### Сonfigure CDN traffic consumption

You can configure this notification in the user account settings: 

1\. Specify the traffic limit in the **Traffic consumption level** field.

2\. Click **Save** to apply the settings. 

<Info>
**Info**

Traffic consumption level is not configured individually, it is the same for all users of the account who use this notification.
</Info>

For example, there are three users in the account: User A, User B, and User C. 

Suppose that User A is the first to turn on this notification and sets the limit to 100 GB. User B and User C will see that the traffic consumption level has already been set by someone and is equal to 100 GB. 

User B agrees with the current traffic consumption level and doesn't change anything. User C believes that the traffic consumption should be changed to 70 GB. After User C makes the changes, the other two users will also receive notifications when the traffic consumption level reaches 70 GB. 

### Configure limits for object storage

You can receive notifications about objects, requests, used space, and traffic consumption. 

To manage the notification settings: 

1\. Navigate to the **Object Storage notifications** section. 

2\. Click **Add limit** button next to the setting you want to modify. 

3\. Enter the required limit. 

4\. Click **Save** to apply the changes. 

To do it go to the **Storage notifications** section, select Storage and Bucket (optional) and specify the limit. Then click **Save**.
