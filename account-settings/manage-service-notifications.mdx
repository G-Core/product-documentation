## Notification categories

Notifications are organized by service and purpose:

### Master toggle

The **Allow notifications** toggle at the top of the page controls all email notifications. When disabled, no notification emails are sent regardless of individual category settings.

### Important notifications

Critical notifications about service availability and account status:

- **Service emails**: API changes, technical updates, and information affecting service availability. Gcore recommends keeping this enabled.
- **Promotional emails**: Newsletters, tips, and special offers. Disabled by default.

### Service-specific notifications

Each Gcore service has its own notification category:

| Category | Notification types |
|----------|-------------------|
| Object Storage | Request limits, object count limits, storage consumption |
| Cloud | DDoS attacks, Kubernetes certificate renewal, limit change requests, resource reservations, AI cluster creation |
| Streaming | Live stream status changes (on/off) |
| Colocation | Scheduled maintenance |
| CDN | SSL certificate errors, certificate expiration, resource suspension, traffic consumption |

### General notifications

Account-wide notifications that apply to all users:

- Protected Network (DDoS) alerts
- Product activation and deactivation
- Trial period start and end
- Payment success and failure
- API token expiration
- Technical support notifications

## Configure notifications

To enable or disable notifications:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications**.
2. Locate the desired notification category.
3. Toggle the switch to enable or disable.

Changes take effect immediately. No save button is required.

### Category-level control

Each category has a master toggle that enables or disables all notifications within that category. Individual notification types can be toggled separately when the category is enabled.

## Usage limit notifications

Some services support threshold-based notifications that trigger when usage reaches a specified limit.

### CDN traffic consumption

To configure CDN traffic alerts:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications**.
2. Expand the **CDN notifications** section.
3. Enable **CDN traffic consumption control**.
4. Enter the threshold value in the **Traffic consumption level** field (in GB).
5. Click **Save**.

Notifications are sent when traffic consumption reaches the specified limit. Traffic is measured from the first day of each month and checked hourly.

<Info>
Traffic consumption limits apply to all users on the account. When one user changes the limit, all users receive notifications based on the new threshold.
</Info>

### Object Storage limits

Object Storage supports multiple limit types:

| Limit type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Number of requests | Triggers when request count reaches the threshold |
| Number of objects | Triggers when object count in a bucket reaches the threshold |

To configure Object Storage limits:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Notifications**.
2. Expand the **Object Storage notifications** section.
3. Click **Add limit** next to the desired limit type.
4. Enter the threshold value.
5. Click **Save**.

## Notification timing

The timing of usage-based notifications depends on the service:

| Service | Check frequency | Reset period |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| CDN traffic | Hourly (at :00 minutes) | Monthly (1st of month) |
| Object Storage requests | Continuous | Monthly (1st of month) |
| Object Storage objects | Continuous | None (absolute count) |

If a newly configured limit is already exceeded, notifications are sent at the next scheduled check.

## Notification scope

| Setting type | Scope |
|--------------|-------|
| Important notifications | Per user |
| Service notifications | Per user |
| General notifications | Shared across all users |
| Usage limits | Shared across all users |

When notification settings are shared, changes made by any user affect all users on the account.
