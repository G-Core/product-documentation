API tokens provide programmatic access to Gcore services without requiring interactive authentication. Permanent tokens are useful for automated processes such as cache clearing, resource provisioning, and monitoring integrations.

To access API tokens, click the avatar in the top-right corner of the Customer Portal, select **Profile**, then select **API tokens** in the sidebar. The API tokens page is where tokens are created, managed, and deleted.

## Token types

Gcore supports two types of API authentication:

| Type | Validity | Use case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Standard token | 1 hour (refreshable to 24 hours) | One-time requests, testing |
| Permanent token | Configurable (up to unlimited) | Automation, integrations, CI/CD |

Standard tokens are temporary session credentials used for interactive or short-lived access. [Standard token authentication](https://api.gcore.com/docs/account#section/Authentication) uses OAuth-style refresh flows.

Permanent tokens are standalone credentials intended for automation and service integrations that run without user interaction.

## Create and use tokens

### Create a token

To create a new API token:

1. In the top-right corner, click **Create token**.
2. Configure the token settings.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Token name | Yes | Descriptive name for identifying the token |
| Description | No | Additional context about the token's purpose |
| Role | Yes | Permission level assigned to the token |
| Expiration | Yes | Token validity period or "Never expire" |

3. Click **Create**.

<Warning>
The generated token is displayed only once. Copy and store the token securely before closing the dialog. The token value cannot be retrieved after the creation dialog is closed.
</Warning>

4. Copy the token value.
5. Click **OK, I've copied token**.

### Role assignment

A token can only be assigned a role equal to or lower than the role of the user creating it. Users with the "User" role cannot create tokens with "Administrators" permissions.

- **Administrators**: Full access to all account features and settings
- **Users**: Standard access with project-level restrictions

### Expiration options

- **Never expire**: Token remains valid indefinitely
- **Set expiration date**: Token expires on the specified date

### Use a token

API tokens authenticate requests as the user who created the token. All permissions and restrictions of that user's role apply to API operations performed with the token.

To authenticate API requests, include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: APIKey <token_value>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: APIKey 7711$eyJ0eXAiOiJKV..." https://api.gcore.com/cdn/resources
```

If a token is exposed or no longer needed, delete it immediately and create a new one.

Token support varies by service and is described in the [IAM API documentation.](https://api.gcore.com/docs/iam)

## Manage tokens

The API tokens page displays all tokens with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique token identifier |
| Token name | Assigned name |
| Issued by | Email of the user who created the token |
| Role | Permission level |
| Status | Active, Expired, or Deleted |
| Expire | Expiration date or "Never expire" |
| Description | Optional description text |
| Start | Token creation date |
| Last usage | Most recent API call using the token |

### Manage the token list

The toolbar above the token table provides options for organizing and viewing tokens:

- **Filters**: Show tokens by status (Active, Expired, or All) or apply additional conditions
- **My Presets**: Save filter configurations for reuse. Click **Save current set as a preset** to create a new preset.
- **Manage Columns**: Choose which table columns are visible
- **Display Density**: Adjust row spacing (compact, comfortable, or spacious)

### Token visibility

Administrators can view and manage all tokens on the account. Other roles can only view and manage tokens they created.

### Delete a token

Deleting a token immediately revokes API access for any application using that token.

1. Locate the token in the list.
2. Click the three-dot menu icon.
3. Select **Delete API token**.

4. Confirm the deletion.

<Info>
Administrators can delete any token on the account. Other users can only delete tokens they created.
</Info>

## Security and lifecycle

### Token limits

Each account can have a maximum of 50 active API tokens. Expired and deleted tokens do not count against this limit.

### Expiration notifications

Email notifications are sent automatically before tokens expire (7 days and 1 day before expiration). Notifications are sent to the user who created the token and all Administrators.

The API tokens section displays an indicator when tokens expire within 7 days. [Notification preferences](/account-settings/manage-service-notifications) can be configured in the Notifications section.

### SSO considerations

When using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO) for login, the Gcore system does not receive permission updates from the identity provider. If a user's access is revoked in the identity provider, any API tokens created by that user remain active.

<Warning>
To restrict API access for SSO users whose permissions have been revoked, manually delete their API tokens from the account.
</Warning>
