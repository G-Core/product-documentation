## What is a permanent API token and when can it be used

An API token is a unique identifier of an application requesting access to your account via the API.

Our API documentation describes how to get a [standard authorization token](https://api.gcore.com/docs/account#section/Authentication) with a validity period of 1 hour, to update it, use the [Refresh token](https://api.gcore.com/docs/account#tag/Account/paths/~1auth~1jwt~1refresh/post) request with a validity period of 24 hours. Such validity periods can be helpful for one-time requests.

To set up an automated process for working with our CDN service (for example, automatic cache clearing), use a permanent API token, which you can create in your personal account.

Please refer to the specific product [API documentation](https://api.gcore.com/docs/iam) to check if it supports permanent API tokens.

To manage services add your permanent API token after APIKey in the authorization header: _'Authorization: APIKey 7711$eyJ0eXAiOiJKV'_

## API token expiration notifications

API token expiration notifications are displayed in your personal account and are sent by default to users who have issued a token and to users with the Administrators role.

You [can configure](/account-settings/manage-service-notifications) notifications in the Notifications section of the Profile tab.

Users are notified by email:

  * 7 days before the token expires.
  * 1 day before the token expires.



The API Tokens section will be marked with an exclamation mark if there are tokens that expire in 7 days or less.

## An API token and SSO

When logging in via SAML SSO, our system does not have information about the status of the permissions granted to the user by the provider.

Even if the provider revoked the user's access rights, their tokens will remain active for account management.

**Important**: If you need to restrict access via a permanent API token for a user with SSO authorization, delete the required token from your Personal Account.
