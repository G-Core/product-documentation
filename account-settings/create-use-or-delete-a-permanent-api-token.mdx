API tokens provide programmatic access to Gcore services without requiring interactive authentication. Permanent tokens are useful for automated processes such as cache clearing, resource provisioning, and monitoring integrations.

To access API tokens, navigate to **Settings** > **API tokens**.

## Token types

Gcore supports two types of API authentication:

| Type | Validity | Use case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Standard token | 1 hour (refreshable to 24 hours) | One-time requests, testing |
| Permanent token | Configurable (up to unlimited) | Automation, integrations, CI/CD |

For standard token authentication, see the [API documentation.](https://api.gcore.com/docs/account#section/Authentication)

## Token limits

Each account can have a maximum of 50 active API tokens. Expired and deleted tokens do not count against this limit.

## Create a permanent API token

To create a new API token:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API tokens**.
2. Click **Create token**.
3. Configure the token settings:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Token name | Yes | Descriptive name for identifying the token |
| Description | No | Additional context about the token's purpose |
| Role | Yes | Permission level assigned to the token |
| Expiration | Yes | Token validity period or "Never expire" |

4. Click **Create**.

<Warning>
The generated token is displayed only once. Copy and store the token securely before closing the dialog. The token value cannot be retrieved after the creation dialog is closed.
</Warning>

5. Copy the token value.
6. Click **OK, I've copied token**.

### Role assignment

A token can only be assigned a role equal to or lower than the role of the user creating it. Users with the "User" role cannot create tokens with "Administrators" permissions.

Available roles:

- **Administrators**: Full access to all account features and settings
- **Users**: Standard access with project-level restrictions

### Expiration options

- **Never expire**: Token remains valid indefinitely
- **Set expiration date**: Token expires on the specified date

## Use an API token

To authenticate API requests with a permanent token, include it in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: APIKey <token_value>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: APIKey 7711$eyJ0eXAiOiJKV..." https://api.gcore.com/cdn/resources
```

Check the [API documentation](https://api.gcore.com/docs/iam) for service-specific token support.

## Manage existing tokens

The API tokens page displays all tokens with the following information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique token identifier |
| Token name | Assigned name |
| Issued by | Email of the user who created the token |
| Role | Permission level |
| Status | Active, Expired, or Deleted |
| Expire | Expiration date or "Never expire" |
| Description | Optional description text |
| Start | Token creation date |
| Last usage | Most recent API call using the token |

### Filter tokens

Filter the token list using:

- **Status**: Active, Expired, or All
- **Add filter**: Additional filter options

### Token visibility

- **Administrators**: Can view and manage all tokens on the account
- **Other roles**: Can only view and manage tokens they created

## Delete an API token

Deleting a token immediately revokes API access for any application using that token.

To delete a token:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API tokens**.
2. Locate the token in the list.
3. Click the three-dot menu icon.
4. Select **Delete**.
5. Confirm the deletion.

<Info>
Administrators can delete any token on the account. Other users can only delete tokens they created.
</Info>

## Token expiration notifications

Email notifications are sent automatically before tokens expire:

- 7 days before expiration
- 1 day before expiration

Notifications are sent to:

- The user who created the token
- All users with the Administrators role

The API tokens section displays an indicator when tokens expire within 7 days.

To configure notification preferences, see [Manage service notifications.](/account-settings/manage-service-notifications)

## Tokens and SSO authentication

When using SAML SSO for login, the Gcore system does not receive permission updates from the identity provider. If a user's access is revoked in the identity provider, any API tokens created by that user remain active.

<Warning>
To restrict API access for SSO users whose permissions have been revoked, manually delete their API tokens from the account.
</Warning>
