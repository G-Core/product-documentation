To open the settings, click the profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select **Profile**:

 <Tip>
**Tip**

To check the settings related to the entire Gcore account, check the [Account profile](/account-settings/account-profile-settings) settings.
</Tip>

## Change a username and contact details

The username and email address shown in your profile settings are the ones you provided when creating a Gcore account. You can change them at any time by clicking the Edit button and making the necessary adjustments. 

Note that you can change your email address up to ten times within a one-hour period. Currently, this option is unavailable if you create an account using Google or GitHub. 

## View last login data

The **Last logins** table includes records of all successful login attempts via password, OAuth, or Single Sign-On (SSO). Additionally, if someone was trying to log into your account using a username and password, the logs will also display records of unsuccessful attempts.

This information can help you detect any unusual activity and make sure that your account is secure and accessible only to trusted users.

<Info>
**Info**

If your account has multiple users, only [Administrators](/account-settings/users/about-users) will be able to view the full history of login attempts. Other users will only see their own login activity.

For each login attempt, you can check the following data: 

  * **Login date**: The date and time of login that are based on the timezone of the device from which the authorization attempt was made. 

  * **IP**: An IP address from which the login was made. 

  * **Success**: Login status, indicating whether a login attempt was successful (true) or unsuccessful (false). 

  * **OS**: An operating system used during the login attempt. 

  * **Browser**: The browser from which the login attempt was made. 

  * **User Agent**: The information about the browser, operating system, and device from which the request was sent to a server.
