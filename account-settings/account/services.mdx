You can manage Gcore services in the Customer Portal on the [Services](https://portal.gcore.com/accounts/settings/services) page. This page displays all available services with their current status.

## Service statuses

Each service can have one of the following statuses:

  * **Active**: The service is enabled and functioning.
  * **Stopped**: The service has been disabled and is no longer available.

## Disable a service

To disable an active service:

1\. Open the [Services](https://portal.gcore.com/accounts/settings/services) page.

2\. Click on the service card to expand it.

3\. Click **Disable service**.

After disabling, the service will continue working until the date specified in the Customer Portal. Then, it will be suspended and no longer available. Upon suspension, the service and its data (associated resources and settings) will be deleted. After a [specified suspension period](/account-settings/billing/data-deletion), complete service deletion will occur.

## Resume or activate a service

To resume a stopped service or activate a new one:

1\. Open the [Services](https://portal.gcore.com/accounts/settings/services) page.

2\. Find the service you need and click **Resume service** (for stopped services) or **Activate service** (for services that haven't been activated yet).
