## Two-factor authentication

[Two-factor authentication](/account-settings/my-profile/two-factor-authentication) (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code in addition to the password during login.

When 2FA is enabled, the section displays:

- **Status badge**: Shows "Enabled" or "Disabled"
- **Disable 2FA**: Removes two-factor authentication from the account
- **Generate backup code**: Creates a backup code for account recovery if access to the authenticator app is lost

<Warning>
Store backup codes in a secure location. If both the authenticator app and backup codes become unavailable, account recovery requires contacting support.
</Warning>

## Password

The Password section provides access to password management:

- Click **Change password** to open the password update dialog

[Password changes](/account-settings/my-profile/change-password) apply immediately. All active sessions remain valid until a manual logout.

## Last logins

The Last logins table displays a history of login attempts to the account. This information helps detect unauthorized access and monitor account security.

Each login record includes:

| IP | IP address from which the login was made |
| Success | Login status: `true` for successful logins, `false` for failed attempts |
| OS | Operating system used during the login attempt |
| Browser | Browser from which the login attempt was made |

- **Date range**: Select a predefined range (Last 24 hours, Last 7 days) or specify custom dates
- **IP address**: Search by specific IP
- **Success status**: Filter by successful or failed attempts
