Gcore bills its customers based on consumption data. This data is collected on the 2nd day of each month to accommodate a potential 24-hour lag window.

However, consumption data is collected approximately every 5 minutes for Cloud Pay-As-You-Go tariffs subject to threshold billing. Costs are compared with the predetermined threshold, currently set 4 â‚¬/$.
