## Billing model

Gcore bills customers based on consumption data collected on the 2nd day of each month. This timing accommodates a potential 24-hour data collection lag.

For Cloud Pay-As-You-Go services subject to threshold billing, consumption data is collected approximately every 5 minutes. Costs are compared against a predetermined threshold (currently set at 4 EUR/USD).

## Expenses

The Expenses page displays a detailed breakdown of all charges across Gcore services.

Each expense record includes:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | Unique expense identifier |
| Date | Billing period (start and end dates) |
| Service | Gcore product generating the charge (Cloud, CDN, Object Storage, etc.) |
| Feature | Specific feature or resource type |
| Pricing rule | Billing type (Commitment, Overcommitment, PAYG) |
| Usage | Quantity consumed with unit of measure |
| Sum | Total charge amount |

### Filter expenses

The expenses table supports filtering by:

- **Sum**: Search by specific amount
