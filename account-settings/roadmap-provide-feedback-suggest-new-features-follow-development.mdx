## What is roadmap?

[Roadmap](https://roadmap.gcore.com) is a platform where you can submit requests for missing features and follow the development process of new features proposed by other community members. You can also leave feedback on new feature development and outcomes. 

The following Gcore are featured in Roadmap: [CDN](https://roadmap.gcore.com/roadmap/b/cdn), [Managed DNS](https://roadmap.gcore.com/roadmap/b/dns), [Edge Cloud](https://roadmap.gcore.com/roadmap/b/cloud), [Video Streaming](https://roadmap.gcore.com/roadmap/b/streaming), and [Web Application Security](https://roadmap.gcore.com/roadmap/b/web-protection). 

## Navigating roadmap

Roadmap has three tabs: main page, products, and changelog.

### Main page

When opening the main [Roadmap](https://roadmap.gcore.com) page, you will see all created posts (or requests) for all products. You can view requests for a specific product only—e.g., Edge Cloud—by clicking on the name of that product at the top of the page. 

Requests are divided into four columns:

  1. **In Review**: Requests made by community members but not yet reviewed by Product Owners (PO)
  2. **Planned**: Requests reviewed and approved by POs
  3. **In Progress**: Requests currently in a development stage
  4. **Completed**: Requests for which new features have been released

You can click each post from the main page and view brief details about its development (its status, the Gcore developer who oversees the request, creation time, and the Gcore admin who created the post,) read comments, and upvote to show interest in the feature.

For example, if we select CDN, the following page will open displaying all relevant posts. Here you can range posts by necessary criteria (date, amount of votes, or status) or search for a particular post by typing keywords in the search bar.

## What features do authorized and unauthorized users have?
