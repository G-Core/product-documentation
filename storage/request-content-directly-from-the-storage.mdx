## Request content directly from the object storage

Use the following schema to request uploaded files:

```sh
http(s)://<bucket-name>.<location>.cloud.gcore.lu
 ```

You can find the hostname on the [Storages](https://storage.gcore.com/storage/list) tab in the "Details" section.

For example, your storage is in the Luxembourg location. You've created a bucket _mybucket_ and uploaded _picture.png_ there:

```sh
/mybucket/picture.png
 ```

The Luxembourg location hostname is:

```sh
s-ed1.cloud.gcore.lu
 ```

URL to request the file from the storage is:

```sh
http://mybucket.s-ed1.cloud.gcore.lu/picture.png
 ```

Object storages support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

## Request content directly from the SFTP storage

Upload your files to the _htdocs_ directory but don't specify the directory when requesting the content.

Use the following schema to form the URLs:

```sh
http://<storage name>.<hostname>/<file name>
 ```

You can find the storage name and hostname on the [Storages](https://storage.gcore.com/storage/list) tab in the "Details" section.

Path to the uploaded file in the storage: 

```sh
sftp://12345-test@ams.origin.gcdn.co:2200/export/home/12345-test/htdocs/picture.png
 ```

Where: 

  * _12345-test_ is a storage name;
  * _ams.origin.gcdn.co_ is a hostname.



URL to request the file from the storage:

```sh
http://12345-test.ams.origin.gcdn.co/picture.png
 ```

SFTP storage works only via HTTP protocol.
