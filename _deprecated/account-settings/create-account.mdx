### For legal entities

If you don’t need to sign a contract with us, you can just use the sign-up process for individuals and start using the services.

If you need to sign a contract, you can reach us via chat or email at [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com). We will ask the sales department to get in touch with you. You can still complete the sign-up process to gain access to the services while your contract is being prepared.
