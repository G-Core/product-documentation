The development of machine learning involves two main stages: training and inference.

In the first stage, an AI model is trained on big data, like an array of images, to recognize and label objects. This results in a trained model.

The second stage is model inference, where the model is used to make predictions from real user requests. For this stage, it's crucial that the AI model can respond promptly to users regardless of network delays, latency, and distance from data centers.

[Gcore GPU Cloud](/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/about-our-ai-infrastructure) is designed for creating and training models. For inference, we offer Gcore Everywhere Inference.

## What is Gcore Everywhere Inference?

Gcore Everywhere Inference allows customers to deploy trained AI models on edge inference nodes. By bringing AI models closer to end users, the technology ensures ultra-fast response times and optimized performance.

Using Anycast endpoints, end users' queries are directed to the nearest running model, resulting in low latency and an enhanced user experience. This setup is automated through a single endpoint, relieving you of the need to manage, scale, and monitor the underlying infrastructure.

## Getting started

Deploy AI models with our global intelligence pipelineâ€”a comprehensive ecosystem that supports the full AI lifecycle, from training to inference. It ensures seamless development, deployment, and operation of AI models at various scales across multiple regions.

To get started, check out our guide on [deploying a model](/edge-ai/everywhere-inference/ai-models/deploy-an-ai-model).

## How Everywhere Inference works

Everywhere Inference combines two technologies:

1\. **Edge Network** : Provides low latency via Anycast balancing and smart routing.

2\. **Serverless flexible GPU infrastructure** : Enables quick initiation, integration, and deployment.

We provide you with an endpoint that can be integrated into your applications. When your users access this endpoint, their requests are delivered to the nearest Edge nodes. This is achieved through Smart Routing technology, which redirects requests to the closest inference region where the trained model is deployed.

We also use [Healthchecks](/dns/dns-failover/configure-and-use-dns-failover) to monitor the availability of pods. If the Amsterdam-1 pod is experiencing downtime, the request will be automatically sent to the geographically closest inference region, such as Amsterdam-2.
