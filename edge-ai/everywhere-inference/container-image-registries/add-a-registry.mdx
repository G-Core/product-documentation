Everywhere Inference supports custom private and public registries in addition to Gcore ones, so you can manage your model images with any service you like.

## Step 1. Initialize a new registry addition

You can initialize a new registry by following these two steps.

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **Everywhere Inference** > **Registries**.


<Frame>![Add a registry](/images/docs/edge-ai/everywhere-inference/container-image-registries/add-a-registry/add-a-registry-1.png)</Frame>



2\. Click **Add registry** in the top right of the screen.

This will open the Add registry dialog, where you can add the authentication credentials for the registry you want to add.

## Step 2. Enter registry configuration

Enter the registry's name, URL, username, and password.

<Tip>
**Tip**

The URL for the Huggingface registry is "". You can create an access token in the [Huggingface settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Use "username" as the Image registry username and the access token as the Image registry password.

## Step 3. Finalize registry addition

After you enter all registry details, click **Add**. Your new registry's name should appear in the list of registries.

You can now select the registry for a custom AI model deployment. To learn how to deploy a custom AI model, read [our guide](/edge-ai/everywhere-inference/ai-models/deploy-an-ai-model).
