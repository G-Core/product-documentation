With Gcore Everywhere Inference, you can deploy trained AI models on edge inference nodes. This provides low response times and optimized performance by bringing AI models closer to users.

End-user queries are directed to the nearest running model using [anycast endpoints](https://gcore.com/learning/what-is-anycast), resulting in low latency and an enhanced user experience. This smart routing is automated through a single endpoint, so there's no need to manage, scale, or monitor the underlying infrastructure—we take care of that on our end.

## Getting started

With our global intelligence pipeline, a comprehensive ecosystem that supports the full AI lifecycle, from training to inference, it's simple to deploy AI models. We empower the seamless development, deployment, and operation of AI models at various scales across multiple regions.

To get started, check out our guide on [deploying a model](/edge-ai/everywhere-inference/ai-models/deploy-an-ai-model).

## How Everywhere Inference works

Everywhere Inference combines two technologies:

  1. **Edge network:** Provides low latency via anycast balancing and smart routing.
  2. **Serverless flexible GPU infrastructure:** Enables quick initiation, integration, and deployment.



We provide you with an endpoint that can be integrated into your applications. When users access this endpoint, their requests are delivered to their nearest edge nodes. This is achieved through Smart Routing technology, which redirects requests to the closest inference region where the trained model is deployed.

We also use [Healthchecks](/dns/dns-failover/configure-and-use-dns-failover) to monitor pod availability. If a pod in one region experiences downtime, the request will be automatically sent to the next geographically closest inference region.

## Use cases

Everywhere Inference is a versatile solution for businesses that require low-latency or real-time model responses. It caters to numerous industries, including the following:

  * **Fintech and banking** : Enables prompt anti-fraud detection and real-time credit scoring.
  * **Healthcare** : Facilitates medical prescriptions based on data from wearable sensors and the analysis of medical data
  * **Gaming** : Supports automatic opponent selection in competitive games, map generation, and maintaining open worlds.
  * **Media** : Provides content analysis, automated transcribing, and translating of interviews.
  * **ISP and internet services** : Offers AI-based traffic analysis and DDoS protection.
  * **Industrial and manufacturing** : Provides real-time defect detection and fast feedback.



## Key benefits

Everywhere Inference offers several key benefits:

  * **Low latency** : With over 180 points of presence worldwide, requests are transferred quickly to the nearest Everywhere Inference pod, resulting in low latency for users.
  * **Flexibility in model selection**. Our model catalog offers leading open-source models at the click of a button. Or, opt to deploy your custom models with ease.
  * **High performance** : Everywhere Inference uses the exclusively the latest, purpose-built NVIDIA GPUs to deliver fast model inference capable of handling the most demanding workloads.
  * **Cost efficiency** : Payments are based solely on the runtime of the containers, which automatically scale in and out based on the number of user requests to keep your operations cost-effective.
  * **Easy control** : Global AI infrastructure can be configured with just a few clicks in the Gcore Customer Portal or by API requests, simplifying management and control.
