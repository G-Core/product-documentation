The deployments section allows you to quickly access your active deployments, their configurations, and logs. You can also check and modify the details of your model deployments.

## All deployments

You can open the list of deployments by [clicking on this link](https://portal.gcore.com/inference-at-the-edge/deployments) or opening the Gcore Customer Portal and navigating to **Everywhere Inference > Deployments**.

## Deployment details

The following deployment details are displayed in the table:

  * Name
  * ID
  * Endpoint URL
  * Creation time
  * Deployment status
  * Running status (i.e., the number and location of replicas)
  * Last status message (i.e., the last error reported by one of the replicas)


<Frame>![Manage AI model deployments](/images/docs/edge-ai/everywhere-inference/ai-models/manage-ai-model-deployments/manage-ai-model-deployments-2.png)</Frame>



Some of the details aren't directly visible; you can view them in the following ways:

  * **Deployment ID:** Hover your mouse cursor over an **ID** icon.
  * **Endpoint URL:** Hover your mouse over the **i** icon.
  * **Replica locations:** Hover your mouse cursor over the numbers in the Running status column.
  * **Last status message:** Click on **View details**.



### Start, stop, and delete deployments

The action menu on the right side of the table, which appears as three horizontal dots, allows you to start, stop, or delete a deployment.

## Hardware, autoscaling, and environment variables

If you want to view or change the hardware, autoscaling settings, or environment variables, click on the deployment name or the **Overview** action of a deployment. This will open the Deployment overview.

 <Tip>
**Tip**

Changes aren't saved automatically, so click the **Save changes** button at the bottom to apply them.
</Tip>

Click the **Settings** tab to view this deployment's hardware, autoscaling configuration, and environment variables.

Under **Pod configuration**, you can change the hardware that runs your model by selecting a Processor type and a VM Flavor from the dropdown.

<Info>
**Info**

A hardware change can have performance implications because each replica has to shut down to apply the changes.

You can also change the autoscaling limits and triggers here.

  * The **Cooldown period** defines the seconds the autoscaler waits after starting a new pod before reacting to autoscaling triggers again.
  * The **Pod lifetime** defines the seconds the auto scaler waits before shutting down idle pods.

<Info>
**Info**

It's a good practice to keep at least two pods running so deployment changes don't cause downtime for your users.
</Info>

You can define Autoscaling triggers for the following conditions:

  * CPU/GPU utilization
  * Memory consumption
  * Request frequency

Like the Pod lifetime, the Scaling down timeout lets you define the period the autoscaler waits for a request before stopping idle pods.

<Tip>
**Tip**

Test the models before deploying them to production so you know how much load they can handle. If your thresholds are too low, you might end up with underutilized pods; if they're too high, requests might fail.
</Tip>

You can define environment variables at the bottom of the Settings tab. Activate the **Set environment variables** toggle to see the variable form.

 <Info>
**Info**

Environment variables are strings. If entering numbers or booleans, ensure your AI model image can handle the conversion.
</Info>

## Deployment logs

If you want to view the logs of your pods, click on the deployment name or the **Overview** action of a deployment. This will open the Deployment overview.

Click the **Logs** tab to view this deployment's latest log output. You can switch between replicas with the **Region** dropdown.

## Active AI model image

If you want to view or change the running image, click on the deployment name or the **Overview** action of a deployment. This will open the Deployment overview.

Click the **Model image** tab to view this deployment's currently configured AI model image.

You can change the image by entering a new **Model image URL** and clicking **Save changes**.

If you want to switch to a private registry, you must add it to the Registry section before you switch the Registry type; otherwise, it will not appear in the Registry dropdown.
