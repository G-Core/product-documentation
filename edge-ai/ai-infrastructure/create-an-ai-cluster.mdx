Let's create a GPU-powered cluster for your AI workloads. 

 1. Open [the GPU Cloud page](https://cloud.gcore.com/gpu-cloud/) in the **Gcore Customer Portal**. You'll be taken to the **Create GPU Cluster** page.

 2. Select a region, which is a physical location of the data center. For example, if you choose Helsinki, your cluster will be deployed on servers in Helsinki.
 3. Select a **GPU Cluster type**:
    - **Virtual GPU:** Uses virtual instances with dedicated GPUs.
    - **Bare metal GPU:** Uses dedicated instances with dedicated GPUs.
    - **Spot bare metal GPU:**  Uses dedicated instances without guaranteed availability.
 4. Select a **GPU Model** and instance type.
 5. Select the **Number of Instances**.
 6. Select the OS [image](/cloud/images/about-images) on which your model will be running.

      />
    </Frame>
 7. (For bare metal clusters) Set up a [network interface](ps://gcore.com/docs/cloud/networking/create-and-manage-a-network). You can choose a public or private one:
    - **Public**: Attach this interface if you plan to use the GPU Cloud with **servers hosted outside Gcore Cloud**. Your cluster will be accessible from external networks.
    - **Private**: If you want to use the service **with Gcore servers only**, your cluster will be available only to internal networks.

    Select one of the existing networks or create a new one to attach to your server.

        style={{ width:"65%" }}
      />
    </Frame>
 8. (Optional) Turn on the **Use floating IP** toggle if you want to use a floating IP address. It'll make your server accessible from outside networks even if they have only a private interface. Create a new IP address or choose an existing one. For more details, check out the article [Create and configure a floating IP address](/cloud/networking/ip-address/create-and-configure-a-floating-ip-address).
 9. (Optional) If you need several network interfaces, click **Add Interface** and repeat the instructions from Step 6.
10. Select one of your SSH keys from the list, add a new key, or generate a key pair. You'll use this SSH key to connect to your cluster.

        style={{ width:"68%" }}
      />
    </Frame>
11. (Optional) To add userdata to your cluster, enable the **User data** toggle and add cloud config information.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/create-ai-cluster-4.png"
        alt="Add cloud config"
        style={{ width:"66%" }}
      />
    </Frame>
12. (Optional) To add metadata to your cluster, enable the **Add tags** toggle and add tags as key-value pairs.

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/create-ai-cluster-5.png"
        alt="Add metadata via tags"
        style={{ width:"67%" }}
      />
    </Frame>
13. Name your cluster and click **Create Cluster**.

You've successfully created the cluster. To connect to your server, use the IP address of your AI Cluster and the SSH key from Step 8.
