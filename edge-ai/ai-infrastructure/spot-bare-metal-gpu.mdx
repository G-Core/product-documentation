Spot Bare Metal GPU clusters are discounted GPU servers that utilize unused capacity at reduced pricing. They provide the same hardware specifications and functionality as standard Bare Metal GPU clusters, with one key difference: Gcore can reclaim these resources with 24 hours' notice when capacity is needed for on-demand workloads.

## Spot vs On-demand

Understanding the difference between Spot and On-demand clusters helps determine which option fits a specific workload.

| Aspect | On-demand (Bare Metal GPU) | Spot (Spot Bare Metal GPU) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Pricing | Standard rates | Discounted rates |
| Availability guarantee | Once provisioned, the cluster remains available until deleted by the user | Can be reclaimed by Gcore with 24 hours' notice |
| Use case | Production workloads, critical applications | Cost-sensitive workloads that tolerate interruption |
| Capacity source | Dedicated capacity | Unused/excess capacity |

On-demand clusters are the default option. Once a cluster is provisioned, it remains available until explicitly deleted. Spot clusters utilize unused capacity and offer lower pricing, but can be terminated when that capacity is needed elsewhere.

## When to use Spot clusters

Spot clusters trade availability guarantees for cost savings. Choose Spot when workloads can tolerate interruptions.

Suitable workloads:

- **Batch processing**: Jobs that can be checkpointed and resumed
- **Training experiments**: Model development and hyperparameter tuning
- **Testing and development**: Non-production workloads
- **Cost optimization**: Workloads where cost savings outweigh availability guarantees

Workloads to avoid on Spot:

- Production inference services requiring high availability
- Time-critical workloads with strict deadlines
- Long-running jobs that cannot be checkpointed
- Any workload where unexpected termination causes significant business impact

## Availability

Spot Bare Metal GPU availability depends on region and current stock. When available, the option appears in the **GPU Cluster type** selector during cluster creation.

If Spot is not visible in a region, only standard Bare Metal GPU is available at that time.

## Reclamation process

Spot clusters can be reclaimed when Gcore needs the capacity for on-demand workloads or other operational requirements. The reclamation process follows a fixed timeline:

1. **Email notification**: An email notification is sent to the account owner 24 hours before reclamation.
2. **24-hour window**: This period allows saving data, transferring workloads, and preparing for cluster deletion.
3. **Cluster deletion**: After the notice period expires, the cluster is deleted and all data on local NVMe storage is permanently erased.

<Warning>
The 24-hour notice period cannot be extended or negotiated. The countdown starts when the email is sent, not when it is read. Ensure the account email is actively monitored.
</Warning>

## Data preservation

When a Spot cluster is reclaimed:

| Resource | What happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Local NVMe storage | Permanently erased |
| File shares | Not affected (independent resource) |
| Object storage (S3) | Not affected |
| External backups | Not affected |

To protect critical data:

- Use [file shares](/cloud/file-shares/configure-file-shares) for datasets and checkpoints
- Save model weights to [object storage](/storage/manage-s3-storage/manage-buckets-via-the-control-panel) regularly
- Implement checkpointing in training scripts

## Pricing

Spot clusters are billed at a discounted rate compared to standard Bare Metal GPU. The exact discount varies by region and GPU model. Current pricing is displayed on the flavor card during cluster creation.

Billing stops when the cluster is deleted, whether by user action or reclamation.

## Creating a Spot cluster

The creation process is identical to standard Bare Metal GPU clusters, with one additional step: acknowledging the Spot terms.

1. Navigate to **GPU Cloud** > **GPU Clusters** > **Bare Metal GPU Clusters**.
2. Click **Create Cluster**.
3. Select a region where Spot is available.
4. In **GPU Cluster type**, select **Spot Bare Metal GPU**.

When selecting Spot, a warning appears with the terms and conditions:

  <img src="/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/spot-bare-metal-gpu/gpu-cluster-spot-warning.png" alt="Spot Bare Metal GPU warning explaining 24-hour notice and data erasure terms" />
</Frame>

The warning states:
- Spot Instances can be suspended by Gcore with 24 hours' notice
- Any data on these instances may be permanently erased after the notice period
- Spot Instances should not be used for critical applications

By selecting Spot Bare Metal GPU, the user agrees to these terms.

5. Complete the remaining configuration steps (image, network, SSH key, etc.).

## Best practices

The following practices help maximize cost savings while minimizing the impact of potential reclamation.

**Checkpoint frequently**: Save training state to file shares or object storage at regular intervals. A checkpoint interval of 1-4 hours ensures minimal progress loss if reclaimed. If reclaimed, training can resume from the last checkpoint on a new cluster.

**Use persistent storage for critical data**: Store datasets, model weights, and outputs on [file shares](/cloud/file-shares/configure-file-shares) or [object storage](/storage/manage-s3-storage/manage-buckets-via-the-control-panel). These resources are not affected by cluster reclamation.

**Monitor the account email**: The 24-hour notice is sent to the account owner's email. Ensure this email is actively monitored, especially during long training runs.

**Automate data transfer**: Implement scripts that automatically sync critical data to persistent storage. This reduces manual intervention during the 24-hour window.

**Design for interruption**: Structure workloads to handle unexpected termination. Avoid monolithic jobs that run for days without checkpoints. Break large training runs into resumable stages.
