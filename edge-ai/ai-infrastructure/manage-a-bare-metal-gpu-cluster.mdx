After creating a GPU cluster, use the cluster details page to monitor nodes, resize the cluster, manage power state, configure network interfaces, and delete cluster resources.

## Access cluster details

To view and manage an existing cluster, open the cluster details page.

1. In the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://portal.gcore.com), navigate to **GPU Cloud**.
2. In the sidebar, expand **GPU Clusters** and select **Bare Metal GPU Clusters**.
3. Click on a cluster name to open the details page.

The cluster details page displays summary information in the header panel:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Cluster ID | Unique identifier for the cluster |
| Pkey ID | InfiniBand Partition Key ID. Displayed as "-" if InfiniBand is not configured or during cluster provisioning |
| OS Distro | Operating system image installed on all nodes |
| Status | Current cluster state |
| Region | Data center location |
| Plan | Monthly pricing plan for the cluster |

The page is organized into tabs: **Overview**, **Power**, **Networking**, **Tags**, **User Actions**, and **Delete**.

<Frame>![Cluster overview page showing header panel and tabs](/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/manage-a-bare-metal-gpu-cluster/cluster-overview.png)</Frame>

## View cluster nodes

The **Overview** tab lists all nodes (servers) in the cluster. Each node entry shows the node name, flavor, assigned IP addresses, status, timestamps, cost, and other metadata. The table supports filtering by name, date range, and status.

<Info>
All nodes in a cluster share the same configuration (image, network settings, file shares) defined at cluster creation.
</Info>

## Resize a cluster

Cluster size can be adjusted after creation by adding or removing nodes.

To resize a cluster:

1. On the **Overview** tab, click **Resize Cluster**.
2. Adjust the instance count using the **+** and **-** buttons.
3. Click **Resize**.

<Frame>![Resize cluster dialog with instance count controls](/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/manage-a-bare-metal-gpu-cluster/cluster-resize-dialog.png)</Frame>

New nodes inherit the cluster's original configuration defined at creation time. The maximum number of nodes is limited by current stock availability in the selected region.

<Info>
While a cluster is in the Resizing state, most management actions are unavailable.
</Info>

<Warning>
When scaling down, the system removes a random node from the cluster. To delete a specific node, use the per-node delete action instead of resize.
</Warning>

### Delete a specific node

To remove a specific node without random selection:

1. Locate the node in the cluster list.
2. Click the actions menu (three dots) on the node row.
3. Select **Delete**.
4. Confirm the deletion.

<Warning>
Deleting the last node in a cluster deletes the entire cluster. All cluster-level metadata is removed.
</Warning>

## Power actions

Power actions control the running state of cluster nodes. Actions can be applied to individual nodes or in bulk.

### Individual node actions

To control a single node:

1. Locate the node in the cluster list.
2. Click the actions menu (three dots) on the node row.
3. Select the desired action:
   - **Power on**: Start the node
   - **Power off**: Shut down the node
   - **Soft reboot**: Graceful restart of the operating system
   - **Hard reboot**: If soft reboot fails, force restart the node
   - **Rebuild**: Reinstall the original operating system image used at cluster creation. All data on local storage is deleted.

### Bulk actions

To apply actions to multiple nodes simultaneously:

1. Select nodes using the checkboxes in the nodes table.
2. Click **Group actions** in the toolbar.
3. Select the action to apply to all selected nodes.

Alternatively, use the **Power** tab to perform soft or hard reboot on all cluster nodes at once.

## Network interfaces

The **Networking** tab displays network interfaces for each node. Click on a node name to expand its interface details. Interface types include:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Public | External IP address for internet access |
| Private | Internal network for communication with other cloud resources |
| InfiniBand | High-speed, low-latency inter-node network for GPU-to-GPU communication |

<Frame>![Networking tab showing node and interface list](/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/manage-a-bare-metal-gpu-cluster/cluster-networking-tab.png)</Frame>

For flavors with InfiniBand, multiple InfiniBand interfaces are created automatically (by default, 8 for H100 configurations). These appear as "GPU-cluster ib-subnet" entries in the interface list.

Click on an interface to expand its details, including IP address, network configuration, and other network information.

### Modify network interfaces

To add network interfaces on a specific node:

1. Navigate to the **Networking** tab.
2. Click on a node to expand its details.
3. Click **Add Interface** or **Add Sub-Interface**.
4. Configure the interface type (public or private) and IP allocation settings as supported by the platform.

<Info>
InfiniBand interfaces are managed by the platform and cannot be modified or deleted. This prevents accidental disruption of inter-node communication.
</Info>

## Console access

For troubleshooting or when SSH access is unavailable, use the browser-based console.

1. In the **Overview** tab, locate the node you want to access.
2. Click **Open Console** in the node row.
3. The console opens in a new browser tab using noVNC.
4. Log in using the same credentials as for SSH access.

<Frame>![Browser-based noVNC console with login prompt](/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/manage-a-bare-metal-gpu-cluster/cluster-console.png)</Frame>

The console provides direct terminal access to the node, useful when network connectivity issues prevent SSH access.

## Tags

Tags are key-value pairs for organizing and categorizing clusters. Tags are applied at the cluster level and inherited by all nodes.

To manage tags:

1. Navigate to the **Tags** tab on the cluster details page.
2. Enable the **Add custom tags** checkbox.
3. Enter the key and value for each tag.
4. Click **Save changes**.

<Frame>![Tags tab with custom tags toggle](/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/manage-a-bare-metal-gpu-cluster/cluster-tags-tab.png)</Frame>

Use tags for billing allocation, environment identification, or organizational purposes.

<Info>
Tags can be modified even while the cluster is in the Resizing state, unlike most other management actions.
</Info>

## User actions

The **User Actions** tab displays a log of all operations performed on the cluster, including creation, deletion, resize, power, and network actions. Use the date and action type filters to narrow results. This log is useful for auditing and troubleshooting.

## Delete a cluster

When a cluster is deleted, local NVMe storage is permanently erased; file shares and object storage remain intact.

To delete a cluster:

1. Navigate to the **Delete** tab on the cluster details page.
2. Click **Delete Cluster**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

<Frame>![Delete tab with warning message and delete button](/images/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/manage-a-bare-metal-gpu-cluster/cluster-delete-tab.png)</Frame>

<Warning>
Cluster deletion is irreversible. Data on local NVMe storage cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Limitations

Current limitations for cluster management:

- **Provisioning time**: Bare Metal GPU servers, especially H100 configurations, may take 15-40 minutes to provision due to hardware preparation.
- **Configuration immutability**: Cluster-level configuration is fixed at creation time. Image, file share integration, and network settings cannot be changed after cluster creation.
- **Node-level settings**: Only network interfaces can be modified on individual nodes. Image and storage cannot be changed.
- **Resize behavior**: Scaling down removes a random node. Use per-node delete for targeted removal.
- **State-based restrictions**: Management actions are restricted while the cluster is in transitional states (for example, Resizing).
