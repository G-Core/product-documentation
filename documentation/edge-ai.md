# Edge AI

Welcome to the Gcore Edge AI documentation page! Here we explain how to create, configure, and troubleshoot Gcore Edge AI products: <a href="https://gcore.com/everywhere-inference" target="_blank">Everywhere Inference</a> and <a href="https://gcore.com/cloud/ai-gpu" target="_blank">GPU Cloud</a>. 

Our Edge AI solutions combine the power of artificial intelligence with edge computing. This allows you to run high-performance computing tasks and deep learning closer to end-user devices, which significantly improves response times and overall efficiency. 

From the left–side menu, you can access in-depth documentation about Edge AI products: 
- **Everywhere Inference**: Deploy trained AI models on-premises, in Gcore’s cloud, public clouds, or in a hybrid configuration, for fast response times and optimized performance.
- **GPU Cloud**: Use Gcore Virtual Machines and Bare Metal servers to boost the productivity of your AI tasks.
