# How long does the service enabling take?

To activate the service <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/web-security/create-and-configure-a-protected-resource" target="_blank">create a resource</a> and change the A-record in your DNS settings. It will take time for the DNS records to get updated (depends on the TTL (time-to-live) record set on your server, which defines DNS records caching time).
