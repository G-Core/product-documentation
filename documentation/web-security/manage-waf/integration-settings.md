# Integration settings

You can specify additional email addresses for receiving scheduled PDF reports and immediate notifications. By default, messages are sent to your primary email.

You can choose to receive PDF reports daily, weekly, or monthly. These reports provide comprehensive details about vulnerabilities, attacks, and incidents detected in your system during the chosen period. Meanwhile, notifications offer a quick summary of triggered events.

## Set up integration

1\. Open the <a href="https://web-protect.gcore.com/waf/settings/integrations" target="_blank">Settings</a> section (the **Integration** tab).
