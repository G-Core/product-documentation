# Integration settings

You can specify additional email addresses that you wish to receive scheduled PDF reports and immediate notifications. By default, messages are sent to your primary email.

You can choose to receive PDF reports daily, weekly, or monthly; they provide comprehensive details about vulnerabilities, attacks, and incidents detected in your system during the chosen period. Notifications offer a quick summary of triggered events.

## Set up integration

1\. Open the <a href="https://web-protect.gcore.com/waf/settings/integrations" target="_blank">Settings</a> section and navigate to the **Integration** tab.
