# Configure personal visibility of products

You can configure personal visibility in the customer's settings: Accounts > Account ID > Products.

To change the product visibility from OFF to ON, confirm and save settings. 

It is allowed to change the product visibility from ON to OFF if a product is in the "New", "Trialend", "Paused", or "Deleted" statuses. As a result:

- All settings for this product become inactive
- Disabled products are not displayed in the customers's personal account

If a product is in "Trial" or "Active" statuses, you will see an error. Switch its status to "Trialend" or "Paused" before disabling the product, and then try again.

**Note**: If you make changes in the customer's personal visibility settings at least once, the visibility statuses of the personalized products will not be available for further changes from the global visibility settings. 

For example, "CDN", "Video Streaming", "Edge Cloud", "Storage", "Web Application Security", and "Managed DNS" products are available for you. 

"CDN", "Video Streaming", and "Edge Cloud" are enabled by default for all customers.

And the "Storage" product is enabled only for one customer, i.e. all three products ("CDN", "Video Streaming", "Edge Cloud", and "Storage") are visible in the personal visibility settings.

By these settings the "Storage" product is considered as the product with individual settings, **all further actions with this product in the global visibility will not affect the "Storage" visibility settings in the personal visibility of this customer**.
