# Configure password policy

We enforce a predefined password security policy that protects your system from unauthorized access. The policy comprises the following rules: 

* **Password reuse**. After a password expires, a user must create and use three unique passwords before using the old password again. The system stores the last three passwords to prevent immediate reuse. 

* **Password expiration**. You can set up the frequency of password expiration or disable this feature altogether. If the policy is disabled, users can retain their passwords indefinitely. 

## Enable password policy

Before setting up the policy, make sure you have disabled the login/password authentication option. If this setting is already applied, skip **Step 1**. 

### Step 1 (Optional). Enable username/password login 

Before configuring the password policy, make sure that the **Username/Password login** option is enabled for a user. Otherwise, you wonâ€™t be able to save the policy settings. 

To enable authorization via username and password: 

1\. In the Admin Portal, navigate to the **Security** settings. 

2\. Click **Authorization**. 

3\. Enable the **Username/Password login** toggle. 

4\. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
