**As the result of switching the global service visibility from OFF to ON** a service is activated for all clients, except clients with individual settings for this service.  

**Switching the global service visibility from ON to OFF** for a service without individual settings is allowed or prohibited depending on the service’s status. 

1\. It is allowed to disable a service if it is in the "New", "Trialend", "Paused", or "Deleted" statuses. As a result:

   - A service becomes inactive in personal visibility settings.
   - All settings for this service become inactive in the service tab (Accounts > Clients > ID  > “Service”).  
   - Disabled services are not displayed in the client's client account. 

2\. It is allowed to disable a service if a service is in "Trial" or "Active" statuses.  Switch its status to "Trialend" or "Paused" before disabling the service and then try again.

For a newly created client are available all the services set in the global visibility settings.
