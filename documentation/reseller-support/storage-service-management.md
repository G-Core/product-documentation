3\. Click on the "Services" tab.

## Activate Service

If the "Activate Service" checkbox is enabled, a client can use the service. You can deactivate the service by unchecking the checkbox.

**Note**:  Keep in mind that deactivating the "Activate service" checkbox may suspend the work of active resources.

## Transition to Deleted status 

After the specified number of days, the Storage service status switches from "TrialEnd"/"Paused" to "Deleted".

All the client's resources and files in Storage will be deleted. To change the number of days for a specific client, email us to [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).
