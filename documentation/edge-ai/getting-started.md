# Getting started

The development of machine learning involves two main stages: training and inference.

In the first stage, an AI model is trained on big data, like an image catalog, to recognize and label objects. This results in a trained model.

**If you want to train AI models**, check out or guide on [creating an AI cluster](https://gcore.com/docs/edge-ai/ai-infrastructure/create-an-ai-cluster) to set up an AI cluster with the [Gcore GPU Cloud](https://gcore.com/cloud/ai-gpu) via the Gcore Customer Portal.

The second stage of AI is [model inference](https://gcore.com/learning/what-is-ai-inference/), where the model makes predictions based on user requests. In this stage, itâ€™s crucial that the AI model can respond promptly to users regardless of network delays, latency, and distance from data centers.

**If you need inference** for open-source models or models you trained yourself, [our guide on deploying AI models](https://gcore.com/docs/edge-ai/everywhere-inference/ai-models/deploy-an-ai-model) explains how to set up [Everywhere Inference](https://gcore.com/everywhere-inference) via the Gcore Customer Portal.
