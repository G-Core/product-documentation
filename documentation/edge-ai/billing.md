# Billing

**Gcore GPU** resources are charged according to the resource type—Virtual Machine or Bare Metal—and its configuration. You can check pricing details at on the <a href="https://gcore.com/cloud/ai-gpu" target="_blank">configurations and prices</a> page.

**Everywhere Inference** is billed for the exact compute time that you use. Resources are charged per minute. Check the payment options for Everywhere Inference on our <a href="https://gcore.com/pricing/cloud#inference." target="_blank">pricing page</a>.

## Billing rules

Resource fees are processed on the second day of each month. If the payment fails, services will be stopped.

We recommend that you retain enough balance in your account to order and use cloud services, so you can access Gcore GPU Cloud resources without interruptions. You'll see a notification in Billing if you need to add funds. For more information, please contact the <a href="mailto:support@gcore.com" target="_blank">Gcore support team</a>.
