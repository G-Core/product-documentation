# Set up two-factor authentication

## Two-factor authentication overview

Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security for your account. It requires both a password and a single-use digital key when logging into your account. Two-factor authentication increases protection for your accounts and prevents them from unauthorized access.

## Configure two-factor authentication

1\. Go to the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/2fa" target="_blank">Two-factor authentication</a> page and click **Enable 2-Factor authentication**.

A pop-up will open.

2\. Download the free app on your mobile device and sign up there. We recommend using one of the following:

- <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Authenticator</a> (for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=ru" target="_blank">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.apple.com/eng/app/google-authenticator/id388497605" target="_blank">iOS</a>/<a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/blackberry-2fa" target="_blank">BlackBerry</a>) 
- <a href="https://microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj" target="_blank">Microsoft Authenticator</a> (for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/eng/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458" target="_blank">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps?hl=en&gl=EN&activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a>) 
- <a href="https://authy.com/download" target="_blank">Authy</a> (for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy" target="_blank">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017" target="_blank">iOS</a>) 


**Note**: If you want to use Google Authenticator, read about <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/account-settings/set-up-two-factor-authentication#possible-issues" target="_blank">possible issues</a> connected with time synchronization between smartphone and PC below.

<expandable-element title="Possible issues with Google Authenticator" id="possible-issues">

If you get an invalid code message but are sure the code is correct, it might be the app's time synchronization issue. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

**For Android**:

- Go to the main menu of the Google Authenticator app.
- Tap **Settings**.
- Tap **Time correction for codes**.
- Tap **Sync now**.

**For iOS**:

- Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone home screen.
- Tap **General**.
- Tap **Date & Time**.
- Disable the **Set Automatically Option** and re-enable it again.
- Reboot your device.

The sync will only affect the internal time of your Google Authenticator app and will not change your device’s **Date & Time** settings.

Please read <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/topic/7189195?hl=en&visit_id=638162867925901194-3363983266&rd=1" target="_blank">Google Authenticator’s own instructions</a> if you have any other questions about using the app.

3\. Scan the QR code from the pop-up window in your account.

4\. Enter the six-digit code generated by the app and click Check.

That’s it! Copy the backup codes (more on this below,) store them securely, and log in with Two-factor authentication. 

### Backup verification codes 

<img src="https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/account-settings/set-up-two-factor-authentication/2fa-30.png" alt="Backup verification codes" width="50%">

Backup verification code can be used if you can’t generate one-time codes while logging in. Click **Generate backup verification codes**. You will have thirty seconds to copy and save five codes in a way convenient to you. Each time the **Generate…** button is pressed again, the old codes will be invalidated.

**Note**: A backup code can be used only once. 

## Log in with two-factor authentication

1\. Enter your email and password on the <a href="https://auth.gcore.com/login/signin" target="_blank">login page</a> and click **Log in**.

<img src="https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/account-settings/set-up-two-factor-authentication/2fa-40.png" alt="Log in with two-factor authentication">

2\. You will be redirected to enter the generated key. Open the app, enter the code displayed there, or use a <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/account-settings/set-up-two-factor-authentication#backup-verification-codes" target="_blank">backup code</a>. Click **Log in**.

You will be redirected to your personal account if the access code is entered correctly. 

## Disable two-factor authentication

Go to the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/2fa" target="_blank">Two-factor authentication</a> page and click **Disable 2-Factor authentication**.

## Filter users by two-factor authentication feature enabled

The <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/users" target="_blank">Users</a> section displays information about which users have activated two-factor authentication. There are two options: “Not activated” and “Activated.” You can filter users by this criterion.
