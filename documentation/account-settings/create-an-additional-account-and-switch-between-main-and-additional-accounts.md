# Create an additional account and switch between main and additional accounts

## Create an additional account

You can manage multiple accounts from your personal account without re-authorization.

This is convenient if you are a user of several accounts and if you need to switch between them while working.

1\. Click on the profile icon in the lower-right corner of the page.

2\. Point the cursor over the account name. A list of all the accounts available to you will be opened. At the end of the list, you will see Create a new account button.

3\. Click **Create a new account**.

4\. Enter a company name and click **Create new account** in the opened window.

**Attention!** The company name must be unique. If a company name already exists in the system, the account will not be created.

If the company name is not registered in the system, the account will be created successfully and displayed in the list of all available accounts. The services of a newly created account are inactive by default.

## Switch to another account

2\. If you have access to multiple accounts, you will be redirected to a page where you can select the account you need.
