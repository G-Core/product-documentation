# Billing overview

Gcore bills its customers based on consumption data. This data is collected on the 2nd day of each month to accommodate a potential 24-hour lag window. The montly billing is described in more detail in the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/how-the-cdn-service-and-its-additional-options-are-billed" target="_blank">CDN billing</a> article.

However, consumption data is collected approximately every 5 minutes for Cloud Pay-As-You-Go tariffs subject to threshold billing. Costs are compared with the predetermined threshold, currently set 4 €/$.
