# Trial conditions

## Overview

The trial period allows you to test the service for free for a limited time, regardless of the plan you choose. Not all services offer a trial period. The table below shows which services offer trials, and any related conditions or comments.

To find information on specific services and tariffs, check <a href="https://gcore.com/pricing/edge-network" target="_blank">Gcore Pricing</a> or your control panel.

*If you already have some services activated*, tariff plan activation (and trial if it exists) will be on the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services" target="_blank">Services</a> Billing page. Click **Activate service** and follow the instructions.

You can also activate the plan by choosing the relevant service in the left navigation menu.

That’s it! We will send you an email at the beginning of the trial and two days before the end of the trial.

Contact support (support@gcore.com or chat) or your manager to extend the trial duration or add GB.

**Note**: The flow differs for some services (e.g., IaaS Protection). Follow the recommendations from the control panel to activate the service.
