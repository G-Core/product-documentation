# Payments and payment methods

Your payment for Gcore products is based on either a pay-as-you-go basis (the actual resource consumption) or a fixed monthly cost associated with a particular product (commitment). Explore our <a href="https://gcore.com/pricing" target="_blank">Pricing page</a> for detailed cost information.

## Payments 

The Payments page in your profile settings shows payment operations that have been processed for your account. For each payment, you can check: 

* **ID**: The unique identifier for a transaction. 
* **Date**: The date when the transaction occurred. 
* **Payment method**: How the payment was made (credit card, debit card, or PayPal). 
* **Sum**: The total paid amount.
* **Status**: The current processing state of the transaction. Check the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/account-settings/billing/payments-and-payment-methods#payment-statuses" target="_blank">Payment statuse</a> section for details.

### Payment statuses 

The Status column displays the current state of your payment, which can be one of the following: 

* **Paid**: The payment was successfully completed. 
* **Unpaid**: The payment failed. 
* **Cancelled**: The payment was cancelled. 
* **Pending**: The payment is being processed. 
* **Refunded**: The payment has been refunded. 

## Filter payment data in the table 

You can filter payment information by the payment method, date, or status. To do so, choose the necessary options from the relevant table dropdowns.
