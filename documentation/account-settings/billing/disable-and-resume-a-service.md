# Disable or resume services

You can disable and resume services in the Gcore Customer Portal. 
  
## Disable services

Open the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services" target="_blank">Services</a> page and locate the service you want to disable. Click on the service block to expand it and then click **Disable service**.

After disabling, the service will continue working until the date specified in the Customer Portal. Then, it will be suspended and no longer available. Upon suspension, the service and its data (associated resources and settings) will be deleted. After a <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/account-settings/billing/data-deletion" target="_blank">specified suspension period</a>, complete service deletion will occur.

## Resume services

Open the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services" target="_blank">Services</a> page, find the service you need, and click **Resume service** and confirm the action.
