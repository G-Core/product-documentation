# Use bonus credits

## Accrual of bonuses

Bonus credits are special points that are credited to your account for a specific period of time. Bonuses can be used as payment for services.  

1 Bonus = 1 unit of currency used in the personal account. 

Bonuses are credited to a special bonus account by the decision of the company's management. 

You bonus credits displays at the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services" target="_blank">Services</a> section.

## Bonuses debiting  

Bonuses are debited automatically as a part of the payment for services: 

- If you are registered as an individual, the amount debited from the payment resource will be reduced by the number of bonus credits.  
- If you are registered as a company, in an invoice the number of bonuses will be counted as a discount.

**Important**: As bonus credits reduce the taxable amount of expenses, the tax is also recalculated downward. 

## Managing bonuses 

To track transactions with bonus credits, go to the Billing section by clicking on the profile icon in the lower right corner and selecting Billing.  

Open the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/bonuses" target="_blank">Bonus credits</a> section.  

This section displays information about bonus credits and all operations with the bonus account: the date when bonus credits were credited, the number of bonus credits in the currency of your personal profile, their expiration date, and status.

For a better search of the desired bonus credits, use the search by sum and date.
