# Use bonus credits

Bonus credits are special points that are credited to your account for a particular period of time. You can use them to pay for our products. Bonuses are credited to a special bonus account by the decision of the company's management. 

We convert bonuses at the following rate: **1 bonus = 1 unit of currency** used in your personal account. For example, € 50 bonuses will equal to 50 euros. 

## View your bonuses

You can check available bonus credits in the billing settings on the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/bonuses" target="_blank">Bonus credits</a> page.

### Bonus credits statuses  

Your bonus credits can have the following statuses:

You can now use the bonus to pay for the Gcore products of your choice. 

## Bonuses debiting  

Bonuses are debited automatically as a part of the payment for products: 

- If you are registered as an individual customer, the amount debited from the payment resource will be reduced by the number of bonus credits.  
- If you are registered as a company, the number of bonuses will be counted as a discount in your invoice. 

<alert-element type="warning" title="Warning">
 
As bonus credits reduce the taxable amount of expenses, the tax is also recalculated downward.
