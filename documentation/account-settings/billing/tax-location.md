# TAX location

Every Gсore client has to specify their tax location in the billing profile. The tax location defines the country whose tax regulations and rates will be applied to a particular account.

## Why is it important to specify the correct tax location?

Correct tax location specified in your billing profile ensures that you are charged the accurate amount of taxes, or you are not charged any taxes at all based on the tax laws and regulations of your country. To learn more about tax rates in different countries, refer to: <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/account-settings/billing/vat-rates-in-different-countries-for-an-individual-and-legal-entity#for-eu-countries" target="_blank">VAT rate in different countries for individuals and legal entities</a>.  

## How is my tax location determined?

Your tax location is typically based on the address in your billing profile and payment method information. In some locations, however, we are required by law to consider other account details, such as your IP address.

## How can I change my tax location? 

You can update your address and view your account’s VAT rate at any time in your billing profile. As we also consider the default payment method added to your account, please proceed to the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/payment-methods" target="_blank">payment methods page</a> to make changes.

If you have set your account details correctly, but your account’s tax location is not what you expect, please contact us via chat or email at [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com). 

## How can I add a VAT number? 

If your business has a registered VAT ID and you want to remove tax charges from your invoice, please contact us via chat or email at [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).
