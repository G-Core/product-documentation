4\. Enter the name of the invited user.

5\. Enter his or her email address.

6\. Specify the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/account-settings/users/about-users" target="_blank">Role</a> of the invited user.

7\. Specify the language of the interface.

8\. Click the **Invite user** button.

**Important**: You can invite both existing and previously not registered users.

*   In case a user is not previously registered in the system, an email will be sent to the email address specified in the invitation with a link to create a password. The invited user should accept the invitation. After creating a password, the user can log in to the account.
*   If a user already exists in the system, a notification about the provided access to the account will be sent to the specified email address. After accepting the invitation, a user will be able to select the required account during authorization.

## Change user's account information

User account information can be changed by 

*   the user
*   a user with an account administrator role.

**If you are an account administrator:**

1\. Go to the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/users" target="_blank">Users</a> section.

2\. Click on the three-point sign next to the user.

3\. Select **Edit**.

In the pop-up window, you can change your (the user with the Administrator role) username, Role, and Language. As for the other users, in their settings, you can change only Role. 

**If you are a user:**

1\. Click on the profile icon in the lower-right corner of the page.

2\. Go to the Profile settings.

3\. Change your account details on the General tab.

## Delete a user

1\. Open the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/users" target="_blank">Users</a> section.

2\. Click on the three-point sign next to the user.

3\. Select **Delete**.

4\. Confirm the deletion.

Now the user has no access to the current account.

### Deletion features

1\. If a user is a part of several accounts and you want to delete this user from all of them, you should do the steps above from each account.

2\. If a permanent API token was issued by a user who is going to be deleted, first delete the required token. Otherwise, an error will appear.

3\. After deleting a user, in the API tokens section, his name and email address will be crossed out next to the tokens issued by him, and a hint will be displayed:
