# How quickly our support team will respond to you

The response time of our support team depends on three parameters:

1. Billing plan
2. The request priority
3. The workload of our support team

## Billing plan

Your billing plan determines how and when we can respond to your question. You can check your billing plan on the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/billing/services" target="_blank">Services</a> page by selecting a service.

Check what support is provided by your plan on the <a href="https://gcore.com/pricing/edge-network" target="_blank">Pricing</a> page.

There are three support modes available:

- **For free plans**, there is no technical support, meaning our support team cannot assist you. However, you can always find answers to your questions in our <a href="https://gcore.com/docs" target="_blank">Knowledge Base</a>. There are hundreds of articles describing how to configure our services and solve issues. 
- **For "medium" plans** (e.g., "Start" CDN plan), we provide support during business hours on business days (8/5). 
- **For PRO+ plans**, we provide round-the-clock support (24/7).

## The request priority

The request priority reflects the impact of service issues on your business. The more critical the problem, the sooner we will start solving it.

| Priority  | Criteria                                                                                                                                       | Response time     |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Urgent | Business-critical functions are unavailable, or degraded and will soon be unavailable                                                          | Within 30 minutes |
| High      | Business-critical functions are partially unavailable or degraded                                                                              | Within 1 hour    |
| Normal    | Non-business-critical functions are inoperable or non-standard errors are observed                                                             | Within 2 hours    |
| Low       | You have a general question concerning the infrastructure; you want to request a new function of the Gcore services or discuss an existing onen | Within 4 hours    |


If you use CDN, Streaming platform, Cloud, Web protection, Storage, or DNS, you can set the priority of the request and manage it in the "Help center" while creating a request. For other services, priority is indicated in the chat on our website.

To create a request, click **Help** and then **Help center**.

The new page will open. Specify the details of your request and set the "Priority" option.

This functionality will soon be available for Hosting clients.

When you send a request by email, it will have "Normal" priority by default. Please feel free to ask to change the priority by emailing our support team.

**Note**: We reserve the right to lower the priority if the issue is not caused by errors in our service, the priority needs to be corrected, or it does not meet our internal criteria.

## The workload of our support team

The support team's workload can affect the response time. If technical support is overloaded, the response time will be increased.

However, it rarely happens. We usually respond earlier than the established deadlines.
