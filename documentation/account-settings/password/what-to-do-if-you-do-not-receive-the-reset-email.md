# What to do if you do not receive the reset email?

If you initiated a password reset but have not received an email within 15 minutes, check your spam folder. The message is titled as “Password Recovery” and sent from [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).

If you cannot find the email, <a href="https://auth.gcore.com/login/forgot-password" target="_blank">start the reset process again</a>.

If there is still no email, contact us.
