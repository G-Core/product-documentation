# Set up two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security for your account. It requires both a password and a single-use digital key when logging into your account. Two-factor authentication increases protection for your accounts and prevents them from unauthorized access.

## Configure two-factor authentication

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to the <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/profile/2fa" target="_blank">Two-factor authentication</a> page.

2\. Click **Enable 2-Factor authentication**.

3\. In the configuration dialog that opens, download an authenticator application on your mobile device and sign up there. We recommend using one of the following: 

- <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Authenticator</a> (for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=ru" target="_blank">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.apple.com/eng/app/google-authenticator/id388497605" target="_blank">iOS</a>/<a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/blackberry-2fa" target="_blank">BlackBerry</a>) 
- <a href="https://microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj" target="_blank">Microsoft Authenticator</a> (for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/eng/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458" target="_blank">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps?hl=en&gl=EN&activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a>)

<expandable-element title="Troubleshooting authenticator apps" id="possible-issues">

If you’re having issues with your authenticator application, check the following troubleshooting steps. 

### Check apps' time synchronization   

Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires synchronized time with the login device to ensure the confirmation method stays up to date. If you get an invalid code message but are sure the code is correct, it might be the app's time synchronization issue.  

To resolve this issue, make sure that the date and time are set correctly, and enable network time synchronization on the device you're using to log in. 

### Use a backup verification code 

Use one of the one-time backup codes that were generated during the setup of 2FA. 

### Check your device configuration 

If you recently changed the device with your authenticator app, check the application settings to verify that it’s configured correctly on the device.

4\. Scan the QR code from the pop-up window in your authenticator application.

5\. Enter the six-digit code generated by the app and click **Check**.

6\. Copy the backup codes and store them securely. These codes can be used to access your account if can’t generate one-time codes from your mobile device.

That’s it! You can now log in to your Gcore account with two-factor authentication. 

### Generate backup verification codes 

If you have used all backup verification codes, you can generate new ones. To do so, click **Generate backup verification codes**.

You will have thirty seconds to copy and save five codes in a way convenient to you. Note that each time you click the **Generate backup verification codes** button, the old codes are invalidated.
