# Create an Object or SFTP storage

## Create a storage

To create a storage:

1. In the Gcore Customer Portal, click the **Add new storage** button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Specify storage name and location. The location name has two parts: storage type (Object Storage or SFTP) and city/region where the data center is located. SFTP locations are added/removed from the list automatically depending on the amount of free storage space available.
3. You can create maximum 3600 storages per account.


### Object Storage

**Note**: There are several limits for Object Storage:

1.  You can create maximum 1000 buckets.Â 
2.  You can place maximum 10M objects in one bucket. However, we recommend placing no more than 100K objects, so storage performance and availability be higher. If you want to place more than 100K objects, it would be better to store them in different buckets.

To create an Object Storage, specify its name and location, and click the **Create** button.

You will see both access and secret key in the next window. Copy and save them since we show the keys only once.

The created storage will appear in the storage list.

To see the information (location, hostname), click the **Details** button.

If you have forgotten to copy the keys and want to change them, click the **Generate new keys** button.

The **Delete storage** button automatically deletes all the files in your storage.

### SFTP

To create an SFTP storage, specify name, location, and preferred authentication method: SSH key or password. Once the storage is created, you will be able to use both.

To see the hostname, click the **Details** button (use port 2200 to connect to the storage).

Password can be set, removed, and updated. To add new keys (up to 5 per storage) or limit access to the uploaded ones go to the SSH keys manager.

To set an alias or regulate the Expires header value, click **Edit**.

Specify a domain name (subdomains are okay too) in the Server alias field, and add the following record to your DNS settings: CNAME *\<server_name>.\<host>*. For example, if your server name is 12345-test, and it is located in Amsterdam, the record would look like *CNAME 12345-test.ams.origin.gcdn.co.*

Expires header can be modified via the "Expires" field. The default value is a year.

## Storage status indicator

Circles on the left from the storage IDs are status indicators.

After creation or settings update (adding keys or changing password), it might take time for the requests to get processed. Orange color indicates a processing state, while green one shows that the storage is ready.
