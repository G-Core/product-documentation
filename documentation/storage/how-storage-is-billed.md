# How Storage is billed  

## Plans and billing rules 

Prices and plans are described on the <a href="https://gcore.com/pricing/storage"  target="_blank">website</a>.

The plan subscription fee and the traffic overcommitment fee are charged on the 2nd day of each month. If the payment fails, the service will be stopped.

Additional features are charged at the beginning of the month.

## Change your plan

Navigate to the Profile icon in the lower-left corner of the page, choose Billing, and change the plan you need. 

The new plan will be applied on the 1st day of the next month.

If you have any questions, please, contact us via chat or email ([support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com)).

## S3 Storage limits

1.  You can create maximum 1000 buckets. 
2.  You can place maximum 1 million objects in one bucket. However, we recommend placing no more than 100 thou objects, so storage performance and availability be higher. If you want to place more than 100 thou ones, it would be better to store them in different buckets.
