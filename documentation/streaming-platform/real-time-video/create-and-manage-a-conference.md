# Create and manage a conference

A conference is a real-time online meeting for several participants.

This format of an online meeting involves the simultaneous transmission of video and audio for two or more participants, as well as screen sharing and the ability to communicate via a text chat.

With Real-Time Video, it is possible to hold online conferences for 2–20 participants.
