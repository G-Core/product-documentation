# Create and manage a webinar

A webinar is a real-time online educational meeting.

This format of the online meeting assumes the participation of speakers and viewers. Speakers use video cameras and microphones. Viewers listen to speakers.

It is important that the viewers can see the speaker, but a speaker cannot see them.

With Real-Time Video, you can conduct webinars for 1-5 speakers and 2000 viewers.

To create an online room for a webinar:
