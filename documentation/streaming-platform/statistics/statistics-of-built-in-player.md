# Video player metrics

Gcore Video Hosting provides you with detailed statistics on the views of your videos through the built-in player. This information helps you monitor the popularity of your content and the efficiency of your video delivery.

## Check built-in player statistics

To check the views of your videos, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Video Hosting** tab in the **Gcore Customer Portal**.
2. Click the video name or the three-dot icon next to it to open the video settings.
3. Select the **Player metrics** tab.

On this tab, you view comprehensive information about the views in the built-in player. 

## Explanation of player statistics

Player statistics are available in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or in your local time zone format.  

By default, the date is presented for the last 24 hours. However, you can adjust the displayed information based on the date and time filters. To keep the data up to date without refreshing the page manually, you can choose the preferred auto refresh interval in the dropdown.

All data displayed on the Player metrics tab reflects only the statistics collected by the built-in HTML player. If users viewed video in external or OS-native players, those views and interactions are not included in the metrics.
