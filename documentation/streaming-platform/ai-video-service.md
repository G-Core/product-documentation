# AI video services

Gcore Video Streaming offers advanced video processing features for both video on demand (VOD) and live streaming: 

* **Transcription and translation of captions**. Our AI Automated Speech Recognition (AI ASR) feature generates and translates subtitles to a wide range of supported languages, making your videos accessible to users around the globe. 

* **Content moderation**. We analyze videos for nudity, offensive language, or violence to ensure that your audience receives safe and appropriate content. 

Our suite of AI-powered video services is comprehensive and fully managed, ensuring seamless integration into your video streaming workflow. 

## AI video services infrastructure 

We use our own Gcore infrastructure to execute AI models. In this way, we ensure that all data is processed within our company on EU and US servers, minimizing the risk of data leaks. 

Using a unified infrastructure facilitates the integration of your project with other Gcore AI-powered solutions, such as the <a href="https://gcore.com/cloud/ai-gpu" target="_blank">AI GPU Cloud</a> for accelerating machine learning and <a href="https://gcore.com/fastedge" target="_blank">FastEdge</a> for low-latency edge computing for serverless app deployment.

## Activate AI video services

To activate the AI video services for your account, send a request to the [Gcore support](mailto:support@gcore.com). While the general usage of the AI video service is free, certain features, like translation, may incur charges. For more details, refer to our <a href="https://gcore.com/pricing/streaming-platform" target="_blank">pricing page</a>. 

## Available features

Upon activation, you can use API methods for subtitle generation and translation. However, these features are only available for videos.
