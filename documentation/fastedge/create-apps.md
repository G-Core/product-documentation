# Create FastEdge apps

FastEdge allows you to run applications in a serverless environment on Gcoreâ€™s scalable CDN network. You can create the following types of FastEdge apps: 

* **HTTP applications**: manage apps that have their own URL and are built using <a href="https://github.com/G-Core/FastEdge-sdk-rust" target="_blank">FastEdge Rust SDK</a>  or <a href="https://github.com/G-Core/FastEdge-sdk-js" target="_blank">FastEdge Javascript SD</a>. 

* **CDN applications**: manage apps that extend the functionality of Gcore CDN and use <a href="https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec" target="_blank">Proxy-Was</a> spec.
