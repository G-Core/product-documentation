Login to your IPS Community Admin area.

Scroll down to CDN Settings.

Type in your CNAME that you specified in the GcoreÂ <a href="https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard" target="_blank">Control panel</a>. Ensure that your <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/create-and-set-a-custom-domain-for-the-content-delivery-via-cdn" target="_blank">CNAME record has been configured</a> in a proper way before using it for integration.

Click the **Update Settings** button at the bottom of the page.

Integration has been completed! We highly recommend you to check the HTML code of your web page to ensure that URLs have been rewritten properly from your original ones to CNAME from the control panel.

To do that press **F12** or open Developers Tools in your browser, choose the Network tab and refresh the page. All static files should have your CNAME in URLs.
