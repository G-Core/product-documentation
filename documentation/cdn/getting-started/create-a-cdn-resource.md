# CDN resource overview

The CDN resource is the proxy between Gcore caching edge servers and your website's origin. You should create a CDN resource to enhance the download speed with our infrastructure. 

There are two types of CDN resources available to use with the unique creation wizard:

- **For the entire site**. Integrate your entire website with our CDN and DNS products. Consult our guide on <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/getting-started/create-a-cdn-resource/create-a-cdn-resource-for-the-entire-site" target="_blank">configuring a CDN resource for the entire site</a>.

- **For static assets only**. Integrate only static content delivery, such as images and CSS styles. Consult our guide on <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/getting-started/create-a-cdn-resource/create-a-cdn-resource-for-only-static-files" target="_blank">configuring a CDN resource for static assets only</a>.

**Note**: You can create up to thirty CDN resources of both types in a sum. If you need an increase to this limitation, contact your personal manager or support team via [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).
