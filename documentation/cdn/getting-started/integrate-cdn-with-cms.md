# About Gcore CDN integration with CMS and hosting platforms

When using a CDN, you need to replace the domain of your application in the content links with the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/create-and-set-a-custom-domain-for-the-content-delivery-via-cdn" target="_blank">custom domain of the created CDN resource</a>. If you don't use a CMS or other off-the-shelf solutions (e.g. AWS S3), this can be done using a script. Contact your developer or consult with Gcore support via email [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).

If you use a CMS, cloud hosting platforms, etc., you can use plugins or dedicated functionality to replace domain in links.
