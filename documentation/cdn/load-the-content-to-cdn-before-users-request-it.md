**Important!** 

 - Prefetch is recommended only for files that **more than 200 MB and less than 5 GB.**
 - If you need to update files stored in the CDN, first <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/clear-cdn-resource-cache-by-url-pattern-or-all" target="_blank">purge</a> these files and then prefetch.
 - One request for prefetch may content only up to 100 paths to files.
 - There is only 1 request per minute available.
