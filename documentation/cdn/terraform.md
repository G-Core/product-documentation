# Terraform

Terraform is a declarative command-line utility used to manage the infrastructure of Terraform partner providers. With this tool, you can manage our CDN product. 

## How it works

To work with Terraform, you need to create a configuration file where you specify the necessary changes to your CDN service — for example, to create a new CDN resource or add an SSL certificate. Then, run a Terraform command to make changes. The utility reads the configuration file and sends necessary API requests. As a result, the required CDN settings are applied.
