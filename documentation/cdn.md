# CDN

Welcome to the <a href="https://gcore.com/cdn" target="_blank">Gcore CDN</a> documentation page! Here we explain how to use, configure, and troubleshoot Gcore’s CDN.

CDN is a distributed content delivery network that allows your website to load faster in users' browsers, regardless of how far they are from the source server.

From the left-side menu, you can access in-depth documentation about CDN:

- **Getting started** – create and integrate a CDN resource with your website, configure the source site to avoid conflicts with the CDN
- **Billing** – how service costs are determined, how to pay for additional features
- **CDN resource options** – configuration of various CDN resource options, such as caching, security, HTTP headers, CORS, optimization for delivering large files and images
- **Origin group** – add and configure a group of origin websites from which the CDN resource will retrieve content
- **SSL certificates** – add your SSL certificate, issue a free Let's Encrypt certificate
- **Purge** – clear the CDN resource cache by specifying the URL, a regular expression, or the CDN resource whose entire cache will be cleared
- **Prefetch** – preload content onto CDN servers
- **Logs** – view and download free logs, enable the paid Row Logs option for more detailed information
- **Reports** – statistics, including traffic volume, response codes, cacheable traffic percentage
- **Grafana, Terraform** – Grafana plugin for CDN statistics, create and configure CDN resources using the Terraform plugin
- **Troubleshooting** – typical issues may arise when using CDN and how to fix them yourself
