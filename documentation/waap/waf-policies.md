# WAF policies

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy is a set of predefined rulesets applied to incoming web traffic. These rules play a crucial role in enhancing the security of your web applications by: 

* Blocking malicious traffic and common attack patterns 

* Preventing data breaches and unauthorized access to your domain 

* Ensuring compliance with security standards 

* Filtering out suspicious IP addresses and bot traffic 

You can customize the WAF's behavior by enabling and disabling specific policy rules for better alignment with your workflows and security requirements.
