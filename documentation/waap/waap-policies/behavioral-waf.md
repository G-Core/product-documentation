# Behavioral WAF

The Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) includes a Behavioral WAF policy group that helps prevent malicious attacks on your websites. The policy group contains a set of sophisticated user behavior and reputation analysis policies, which inspect the traffic and defend your website against such threats as spamming or brute force attacks. 

## Configure policy group 

You can review the Advanced API protection policy group and enable or disable its policies in the Gcore Customer Portal: 

1\. Navigate to **WAAP** > **Domains**.

2\. Find the domain where you want to configure the policy and click the domain name to open it.  

3\. In the sidebar menu, click **WAAP**. 

4\. On the **Policies** page that opens, click **Behavioral WAAP** to expand the section and adjust the policies.

### Anti-spam 

Use CAPTCHA and JavaScript validation when user activity during a session suggests aggressive use of forms to generate new accounts, post spam content, and similar. 

### Probing and forced browsing 

Use CAPTCHA and JavaScript validation to challenge brute-forced requests on random URLs, which might aim to discover your web application's structure and hidden directories. Requests that fail to pass the validation will be blocked.  

### Obfuscated attacks and zero-day mitigation 

Block clients that perform multiple injection attacks. 

### Repeated violations 

Present with CAPTCHA or block those clients that failed to answer a previously displayed challenge. Requests that fail to pass the validation will be blocked. 

### Brute-force protection 

Present users with CAPTCHA when thereâ€™s an attempt to guess usernames and passwords on web login forms. If the client fails to pass the validation after a few attempts, the request will be blocked.
