# Common automated services

This policy group functions uniquely in WAAP. Instead of challenging or blocking incoming traffic like other policy groups, itâ€™s designed to recognize and allow traffic from legitimate automated services.  

These services include: 

* Common web crawlers like Google and Microsoft bots
* Preview fetch bots like Slack, Facebook, or Twitter
* SEO and monitoring tools
* Other tools like Instant Payment Notification (IPN) requests from PayPal or HiPay 

All these automation services often access your domain to gather some information and are considered beneficial or necessary for normal web activities. Note that some policies are disabled by default, and you need to enable them to permit traffic from the relevant services. 

In some cases, you might want to do the opposite and restrict automation tools from accessing your domain. For instance, you can do so to enforce specific data protection requirements on a domain, protect it from potentially harmful services, or restrict paid content from unauthorized use. In this case, disable particular bots in the Common automated services policy group.
