# Common automation services

Legitimate automation services such as web crawlers, security scanners, or SEO tools can often access your domain to gather some information. Such services operate without triggering any security measures as they're considered beneficial or necessary for normal web activities. 

However, sometimes you may want to restrict which services can access your domain. For instance, if you need to enforce specific data protection requirements on a domain, protect it from potentially harmful services, or restrict paid content from unauthorized use.  

You can do so by enabling or disabling particular bots in the Common automation services policy group. 

## Configure policy group

You can review and enable relevant policies in the Gcore Customer Portal:

1\. Navigate to **WAAP** > **Domains**.

2\. Find the domain where you want to configure the policy and click the domain name to open it.  

3\. In the sidebar menu, click **WAAP**. 

4\. On the **Policies** page that opens, click **Common automated services** to expand the section and adjust the policies.
