# WAAP policies

WAAP comes with a set of default policy groups that enhance the security of your web applications by:Â 

- Blocking malicious traffic and common attack patterns
- Preventing data breaches and unauthorized access to your domain
- Ensuring compliance with security standards
- Filtering suspicious IP addresses and bot traffic

You can customize WAAP behavior by enabling and disabling specific policies for better alignment with your workflows and security requirements.
