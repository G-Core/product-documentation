# WAAP policies

A WAAP policy group is a set of predefined security policies that are applied to incoming web traffic. These policies play a crucial role in enhancing the security of your web applications by: 

- Blocking malicious traffic and common attack patterns
- Preventing data breaches and unauthorized access to your domain
- Ensuring compliance with security standards
- Filtering out suspicious IP addresses and bot traffic

You can customize the WAAP's behavior by enabling and disabling specific policies for better alignment with your workflows and security requirements.
