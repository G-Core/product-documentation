# View statistics on expenses

Customer reports contain statistics on expenses for Cloud platform services. 

Statistics on expenses in the Cloud can be found in the Customer reports section.

The section generates a report on projects and resources that allows you to accurately forecast expenses. 

 You can configure the filter by: 

*   Project 
*   Region 
*   Resource type

And by consumption period.

*   Resource usage in hours,
*   In Gigabyte-minutes by resources, 
*   The total number of outbound GBs and hours of using different flavors. 

To switch between charts, click the tab name above the chart.
