# Manage user access to your project 

If you want to add a new user to your project, follow this article: <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/getting-started/projects/users/add-a-new-user-to-your-project" target="_blank">Add a new user to your project</a>

To learn more about user roles and rights, refer to the article: <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/getting-started/projects/users/user-roles-and-rights" target="_blank">User roles and rights</a>

If you have enough rights, you can regulate user rights. Click Edit to go to the user settings.
