# Create and manage projects

Projects are goal-specific containers in which you can create instances, volumes, networks, and other Cloud resources.

## Create a project 

All users have a default project created automatically. This project cannot be deleted. 

1\. Click **Create project** in the **Projects** tab.

2\. Fill in the **Name** and **Description** fields.

-   Use between 3 and 63 characters: Latin letters, numbers, hyphens.
-   Don't use a hyphen at the end of the field.  

3\. Click **Create project**.  

Your project's size doesn't affect the service price directly. Charges are calculated based on the resources used in the projects.  

## Manage a project

You can Open each project, go to its Settings or Delete it. To do this, click the icon next to the project you want to manage.

By clicking the **Open** button, you get to the resource management panel. 

In the **Settings** of your project, you can edit the project name and description, and configure access rights. 

If you are an Account owner or Administrator, you can delete projects. To lear more about user roles, refer to the article <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/getting-started/projects/users/user-roles-and-rights" target="_blank">"User roles and rights"</a>.

Note: The default project cannot be deleted.
