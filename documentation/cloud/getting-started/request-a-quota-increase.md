# Request a quota increase

## Overview

On the **Quotas Viewer** page, you can find how much of the available resources (Virtual Machines shared count, vCPUs count, RAM size, etc.) you're currently using, check resource limits, and request more resources. We'll review your request for up to two business days.

<alert-element type="info" title="Info">

Limit changes don't affect your payments. We charge only for the used resources.

</alert-element>

Categories group the resources for which there are quotas:

- Computer Service
- Storage
- Network Service
- Load Balancer Service
- Kubernetes Service
- AI
- Functions Service
- Logging Service
- Database Service

## How to send a request

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **Quotas Viewer** in the Cloud Management section and select the region where you want to request a quota increase.

2\. Select the desired quota category to open the list of included resources or type the name in the search bar. Set the desired amount of resources requested by clicking plus or minus on the right, or write the number manually. An orange circle appears next to the line where you changed the number of resources.

<alert-element type="info" title="Info">

You can increase the number of resources in several categories per request. If you want to request an increase in the quota in several regions at once, specify the number of resources in one region (e.g., Amsterdam) and then choose another region (e.g., Frankfurt) and identify resources there.

3\. Check whether the number of quotas in all regions (if you have selected several) is correct in the "Selected resources" block on the right. If something is wrong, correct it right in the block.

Note that you can send only ten quota requests not processed by the support team. Not processed requests mean that requests are in progress: not approved or rejected. You will see an error if there are more than ten quota requests. In this case, please get in touch with the support team.
