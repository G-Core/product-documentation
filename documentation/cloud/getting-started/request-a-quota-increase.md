# Request a quota increase
In the Quotas section, you can find how much of the available resources (like RAM size, CPUs count, etc.) you're currently using as well as limits to it. Also, you can request more resources. We will consider your request within two business days and send an email — will write to you, whether the limit extension has been approved.

All quotes are grouped by categories.

4\. If you want to request an increase in the quota in several regions at once, go to other regions and check the boxes inside as well.

5\. To send a request, click the "Request limit increase" button.

6\. Specify the new limits in the "You should set the final value here" section. For example, if you can create only 10 instances within the current quotas, and you want to create 13, specify the number 13 in the line "Instances Dedicated Count".

Below, leave a comment for our technical support — write what you are requesting resources for.

**Important!** You can send only 10 quota requests not processed by the Support Team. Not processed requests mean that requests are in progress: not approved and not rejected. If there are more than 10 quota requests, you will see an error. In this case, please, contact the Support Team. 

Limit changes don't affect your payments. We charge only for the used resources.
