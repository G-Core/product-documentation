# Prometheus exporter

## What is Prometheus exporter?

The Prometheus exporter is a service that offers OpenSearch index metrics to clients. It provides secure access to user-specific metrics for authenticated users. 

## How does it work?

You configure your Prometheus target, providing the Prometheus exporter endpoint and your Logging credentials using HTTPS Basic Authentication. For example, the Prometheus target configuration for Luxembourg would look like this:

<code-block>
 - job_name: 'your_awesome_job'
    scrape_interval: 5m
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    scheme: https
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['<span style="color:#FF5913">laas-exporter.k1.luxembourg-1.cloud.gcore.com</span>']
    metrics_path: "/v1/opensearch/indices/metrics"
    basic_auth:
      username: '<span style="color:#FF5913">yourLaasUsername</span>'
      password: '<span style="color:#FF5913">yourLaasPassword</span>'
</code-block>

The Prometheus exporter endpoint for your region in specified in your control panel. 

## Understand the key metrics

The table below explains the key metrics provided by the Prometheus exporter. These metrics offer valuable insights into the health and usage of your Logging environment.
