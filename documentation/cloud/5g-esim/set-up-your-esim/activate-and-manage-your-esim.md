# Activate and manage your eSIM 

## Activate your eSIM

To activate your eSIM, you can scan the carrier's QR code, install an assigned plan, or enter the information manually.

### Scan a QR code

1\. Open the Camera app and scan your QR code.

2\. When the **Cellular Plan Detected** notification appears, tap it.

3\. Tap **Continue** at the bottom of the screen.

4\. Tap **Add Cellular Plan**.

If you're asked to enter a confirmation code to activate the eSIM, enter the number that your carrier provided.

### Install an assigned cellular plan

With iOS 13, some carriers can assign a cellular plan for you to install. Contact us for more information.

If a plan was assigned to you, follow these steps: 

1\. When a notification appears that says **Carrier Cellular Plan Ready to Be Installed**, tap it.

2\. In the **Settings** app, tap **Carrier Cellular Plan Ready to Be Installed**.

3\. Tap **Continue** at the bottom of the screen.

### Enter the information manually

Tap **Enter Details Manually** at the bottom of your screen.

## Switch between eSIMs

You can store more than one eSIM in your iPhone, but you can use only one at a time. To switch eSIMs, tap **Settings** → either **Cellular** or **Mobile Data** → the plan you want to use. Then tap **Turn On This Line**.

## Change your cellular data line

Only one line at a time can use cellular data. To change which line uses cellular data, follow these steps: 

1\. Go to **Settings**.

2\. Go to **Cellular/Mobile Data**.

3\. Tap again **Cellular/Mobile Data**.

4\. Tap the line you want to use cellular data.

If you turn on **Allow Cellular/Mobile Data Switching**, you will allow your device to use mobile data from both lines depending on coverage and availability. 

## Delete your eSIM

To delete your eSIM, contact our technical support via chat or email [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com) to avoid any issues.

If you have accidentally deleted your eSIM, please reach out to us to obtain a new QR code and download a new eSIM.

To deactivate your eSIM profile, go to **Settings** → **Cellular/Mobile Data**, select the required eSIM from the list and turn off the **Turn On This Line** toggle. You can reactivate it whenever needed.
