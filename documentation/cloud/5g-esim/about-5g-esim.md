## Advantages of 5G

5G offers a number of important user benefits.

1\. **Ultra-low latency**. 5G technology offers ultra-low latency, which translates into minimal delay in data transmission. This powers real-time applications, like video streaming or online gaming, to run with near-instantaneous response times.

2\. **Local network**. With the 5G eSIM technology, you can access the Gcore Cloud resources via the local network on a mobile device. 

3\. **Global presence with unlimited internet**. Our 5G network covers 183 countries, eliminating the need for additional roaming packages, unpredictable fees, and switching between SIM cards.

4\. **Secure and encrypted data transmission**. The Gcore 5G Cloud solution guarantees secure data transmission through advanced encryption algorithms and security protocols, allowing for controlling and managing the access of each individual SIM card.

## Use cases of 5G eSIM

The use cases for 5G eSIM span across industries, making 5G eSIM a smart choice for diverse use cases.

1\. **ML diagnostics**. Healthcare providers can leverage 5G technology with the Cloud AI platform to monitor real-time patient health data. The Cloud AI platform processes medical images and then returns them to the device for further use.

2\. **Private smart factories**. 5G technology improves industrial automation and productivity. By monitoring device data, manufacturers can implement predictive maintenance and identify patterns that indicate potential problems or failures.

3\. **Connected IOT**. The Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) platform enables intelligent driving, real-time HD maps, and improved road safety. Low latency access to Cloud infrastructure enables real-time data processing, analytics, and secure connectivity.

4\. **Live streaming**. The 5G Cloud platform enables seamless, high-quality, live streaming with interactive experiences. Real-time video analytics enable the generation of live statistics that enhance the live event experience.

5\. **Secure remote access to corporate tools**. The solution allows authorized individuals to access a companyâ€™s digital resources, data, and applications securely from a remote location without requiring a VPN or firewall. This is achieved by enabling access control management for each individual SIM card.
