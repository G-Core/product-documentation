# Quality of Service

Quality of Service (QoS) is a method used to manage data consumption without blocking or restricting access to specific internet resources. The use cases of QoS include: 

1\. **Limit on certain online activities**. You can control the speed and availability of certain online activities using predefined settings. For example, with a QoS set to 128 Mbps in a package, your users can check mail or chat on instant messaging platforms, but they wonâ€™t be able to stream videos.

2\. **Permanent speed limit**. Our system offers seven different QoS presets that allow you to set a permanent bandwidth speed limit, ranging from 32 Kbps to 2 Mbps.

3\. **Bandwidth limit based on data threshold**. You can restrict bandwidth after a user reaches a specific threshold of data usage. For example, you can create a package with unrestricted access until the user consumes 200 MB of data in a day. Once the user crosses this threshold, their bandwidth can be automatically reduced to 128 Kbps until midnight.
