# Account types and permissions

We offer two types of accounts: users and teammates. 

A **user** is an employee of your organization who uses the connectivity services with eSIM cards.

A **teammate** is an individual who is invited to join a workspace and serves as an administrator, manager, or accountant. 

To control access to certain data and features within your team, you can customize permissions for each teammate. In the teammates section of your settings menu, you can edit the permissions of each team member.

These are the available permissions:

- **Owner**

- **Admin**: Best for system administrators, team supervisors, or trusted accountants. Admins have the same set of permissions as Owners, except that Admins cannot manage other admins or owners. (Like Owners, they can manage teammates.)

- **Accountant**: Best for supervisors or accountants who need access only to reporting and statistics.

- **Manager**: Best for managers who don’t need to control critical system settings or manage other teammates’ access.

The following table illustrates the specific data and features that teammates with varying permissions can access.
