To connect, the system will ask you to enter your username and password. The location of them depends on the instance’s OS.

## Connect to a Linux instance 

You will see the login to the right of the “Access to Console” button. There is an inscription of the “\[login\]@\[IP of the instance\]” type. Most often, the login coincides with the name of the OS. For example, for the instance below it is "ubuntu".

You entered the password during the <a href=“https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/create-an-instance” target="_blank">creation of the instance</a> when you filled in the user data in the "Additional options" field. Please note: if the instance is only in a private subnet, DHCP must be enabled in the settings of this subnet so you can log in with a password.

If you forgot your password, you can find it inside the system by <a href=“https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/connect/connect-to-your-instance-via-SSH” target="_blank">connecting to the instance via SSH</a>. Enter the `sudo cat /var/lib/cloud/instance/user-data.txt` command and you will see the password in the line “password: \[your password\]”.

Please note: if you entered the password as a hash, you will see the hash on the screen. In this case, you will not be able to find out the password.

Enter your username and password when connecting, and you will access the instance.
