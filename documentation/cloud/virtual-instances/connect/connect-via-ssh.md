# Connect to an instance via SSH

The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one server to another. You can use SSH to connect to virtual instances running the Linux operating system.

The connection can be established in two ways: by using only SSH keys or the keys and a password. However, the second option is available only if you set up the password during instance creation. Learn how to set up a password for Linux in this guide: <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/virtual-instances/customize-initial-setup-for-your-instance#customize-the-initial-setup-for-your-instance" target="_blank">Customize the initial setup of your instance</a>.
