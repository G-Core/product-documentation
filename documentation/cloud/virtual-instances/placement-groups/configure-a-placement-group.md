# Configure a placement group

## Create a placement group

In the “Placement Groups” section, create a new group. Give it a name and select a policy — affinity or anti-affinity — and click Create Placement Group.

## Create an instance included in a placement group

When creating an instance, in the "Additional options" section, move the "Add to placement group" slider and select a group or create a new one — the machine will be a member of it.

## Add a previously created instance to a group

In the instance menu, open the “Placement Group” tab. Select the previously created group where you want to add the instance to, or create a new one. Click “Add”.
