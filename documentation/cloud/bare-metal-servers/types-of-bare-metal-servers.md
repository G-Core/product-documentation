# Types of Bare Metal servers

We offer various types of Bare Metal servers optimized for specific use cases and workload demands: 

* **High-frequency**: Optimized for high processing speeds with single-core performance. Ideal for workloads requiring fast, high-frequency computing power, such as real-time analytics, low-latency applications or gaming servers. 

* **Infrastructure**: Multi-core servers with multiple CPU sockets designed to handle applications demanding a high number of cores. Perfect for enterprise workloads, large databases, and virtualized environments. 

* **Basic**: Core servers designed for lightweight applications, development environments, or micro-containers. This is a cost-effective solution for general-purpose workloads. 

Check out the following sections for a detailed overview of these Bare Metal server types and the relevant use cases. 

## High frequency 

Bare Metal servers equipped with high-frequency CPUs are suitable for applications that are demanding in processor frequency. 

### Use cases 

Multiplayer gaming, CAD applications, media processing, and rendering tasks.
