# Connect to a Windows server

To connect to a Windows server, use the default Remote Desktop Connection application. You will need to enter the following information:

- Username
- Password

To find this information, follow these steps:

1\. In the left menu, select **Products/Services** → **Dedicated servers** or **Virtual private servers**.
2\. Click the server you want to connect to.
3\. Click the **Instructions** menu in the upper menu bar to find the IP address, username, and password.
