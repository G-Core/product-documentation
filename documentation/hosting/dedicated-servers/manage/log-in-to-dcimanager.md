# Log in to DCImanager

You can manage the server directly from the DCIManager panel. You can get to the panel by clicking "To panel".

You need special login and password to work with the DCI panel. Please keep in mind that this data does not match hosting control panel credentials. You can find the login information in the email that was sent to you after a server activation, or in a section with instructions for this server.
