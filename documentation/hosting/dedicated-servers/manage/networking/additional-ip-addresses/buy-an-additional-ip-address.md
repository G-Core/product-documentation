# Buy an additional IP address

Every dedicated server includes:

- one free IPv4 address, and 
- one free IPv6 address. 

Additionally, you can buy up to 14 IPv4 addresses and 14 IPv6 addresses.

**Note**: Virtual private servers have an exceptionâ€”for *KVM-SSD-1* servers, you can only buy up to two *IPv4 addresses* and *two IPv6 addresses*.

1\. Go to the "Dedicated Servers" or "Virtual private servers" tab in the Control Panel.

2\. Choose server for which one you'd like to order additional IPs, click **IP addresses**.

4\. Enter a number of IPs and pay for your order.

After finishing the order configure the IPs on your server. To configure a big amount of IPs automatically reinstall your operating system.

## How to move IPs from one server to another

Only additional IPs are able to be moved, the main IP stays associated with the server. Notice that it is a paid service.

To move additional IPs from one server to another contact us via a chat or create a ticket in the Control Panel.
