Enter a number of IPs and pay for your order.

After finishing the order configure the IPs on your server. To configure a big amount of IPs automatically reinstall your operating system.

How to move IPs from one server to another

Only additional IPs are able to be moved, the main IP stays associated with the server. Notice that it is a paid service.

To move additional IPs from one server to another contact us via a chat or create a ticket in the Control Panel.
