# Troubleshoot packet loss and high ping

If you ping a server, and some of the packets are lost, or they take too much time to return (more than 110 milliseconds), it indicates a network issue.

Please note that this article is for those whose server is available, despite the network issue. If the server does not return any packets at all, please refer to the guide <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/dedicated-servers/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-a-server-that-is-not-responding-to-ping-requests" target="_blank">for the case when a server does not respond to ping</a>.

1\. If you are using a proxy or VPN, disable it and ping again. If it helps, the problem was caused by an intermediate server. Connect without it or consider changing the VPN/proxy.

2\. If you have recently changed network settings, return to the previous settings and ping again. If it helps, continue using the old settings which works better.

To return your network settings to the default parameters, reinstall your OS. Refer to the guides:

- <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/dedicated-servers/manage/operating-system/install-a-linux-os-from-a-template" target="_blank">Reinstall your OS from our templates</a>. 
- <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/dedicated-servers/manage/operating-system/install-a-linux-os-from-your-iso-image" target="_blank">Reinstall your OS from an ISO image</a>.

3\. If the steps above are not applicable to you, or they donâ€™t help, <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/contact-our-technical-support" target="_blank">contact our technical support</a>. Please provide the following information in your message:
