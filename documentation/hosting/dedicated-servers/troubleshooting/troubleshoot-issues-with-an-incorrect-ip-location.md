# Troubleshoot issues with an incorrect IP location

All our IP addresses have the same location as the data center where you have bought the server. We recommend checking IP location via these two official services - <a href="https://maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo?pkit_lang=en" target="_blank">maxmind.com</a> & <a href="https://stat.ripe.net" target="_blank">RIPE</a>.

Other online services update information about IP location with a delay. That's why you can see incorrect location while using such services.

If you have checked IP location via <a href="https://maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo?pkit_lang=en" target="_blank">maxmind.com</a> or <a href="https://stat.ripe.net" target="_blank">RIPE</a> and noticed that it shows the wrong location too, contact us via chat or ticket. Then we'll send an updating location inquiry to them.
