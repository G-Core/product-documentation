# Remove your IP address from blacklists

An IP address is sometimes added to blacklists due to malicious activity such as spamming or sending bulk messages. If your mail server is blacklisted, some of your emails may not be delivered.

Please note that according to clause 6.4 of the User Agreement, **we cannot influence third-party restrictions**. If your IP address is blocked, you may consider purchasing an additional IP address or using the methods outlined below to remove the IP address from blacklists.

It is important to note that **Gcore does NOT tolerate** the use of its services for distributing unsolicited emails, chain letters, mailbombs, or SPAM (including in particular unsolicited bulk e-mail ("UBE") and/or UCE) in accordance with the Acceptable Use Policy. You may find more information on this within the <a href="https://gcore.com/legal/" target="_blank">Legal Information</a> section.

## Avoid being blacklisted

To reduce the chances of getting blacklisted, please follow these recommendations while using Gcore services for email purposes that are not associated with spam or any other related activity:

1. Ensure that your emails include an unsubscribe link.
2. Make sure all recipients are authorized to receive emails from you.
3. Check that all DNS records are configured correctly.
