# About dedicated servers

A perfect solution for almost any project, fast modern Intel Xeon E3-1270 v5 processors and DDR 4 ECC memory, as well as large size disks. Excellent connectivity worldwide! Our servers are suitable for various projects such as site hosting, game servers and others. IPMI management included in a cost allows you to install independently any operating system on a server.

Dedicated server is a physical server for your project's tasks with an ability to use all your machine's resources and to install any software. The service is used when you need to store large amounts of data, allocate resource-intensive projects, work with applications that are incompatible with virtualization systems, and solve project tasks with specific requirements for server configuration.
