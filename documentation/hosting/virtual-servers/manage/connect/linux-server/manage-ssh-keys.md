SSH key will be automatically added to all future servers and used OS. That is, using a specific key, you can connect to the server if:

- You had bought a server, had added an SSH key and later reinstalled the OS on the server

To change the key go to SSH keys - Edit. To delete it go to SSH keys - Delete.
