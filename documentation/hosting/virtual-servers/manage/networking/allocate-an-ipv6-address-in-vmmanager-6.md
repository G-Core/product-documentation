# Allocate an IPv6 address in VMmanager 6

After activation, every virtual server is allocated a separate IPv6 subnet, and the first IP address of the subnet is automatically assigned to its interface.

To find the IP address, go to the **Virtual machines** tab and expand the **all 2** menu in the **IP address** column.

If you want to change the IPv6 address, you can do so manually in the OS settings.
