Additionally, you can buy up to nine IPv4 addresses and nine IPv6 addresses. **Exception**: For KVM-SSD-1 servers, you can only buy up to two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

Enter a number of IPs and pay for your order. 

After finishing the order, configure the IPs on your server. To configure a high number of IPs automatically reinstall your operating system.  

## How to move IPs from one server to another

Only additional IPs can be moved, the main IP stays associated with the server. Notice that it is a paid service.

To move additional IPs from one server to another, contact us via a chat or create a ticket in the Control Panel.
