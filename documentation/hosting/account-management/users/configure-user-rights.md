# Configure user rights

In the Control Panel, you can set the user rights, allowing or denying them access to the different sections and restricting the execution of operations.

To switch to the access rights editing mode, go to Client - Users. Select the user and click Perm.

Rights are grouped by sections. In each section, you can give a user permission to edit forms and view data.

Double-click the attribute to configure the further rights.

To activate access to a subsection of the Control Panel, select the line with the desired attribute and click **Enable** in the top menu.
