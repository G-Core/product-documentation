# Activate BGP

BGP is the announcement of your own IP-addresses using our equipment. It can be helpful if you resell our servers or want to avoid the Chinese Firewall.

BGP is available only on dedicated servers. The service is paid and is not available in all locations. Check the price and range of locations with technical support.

To get BGP, order the service from the Control Panel and contact via ticket us to set it up.
