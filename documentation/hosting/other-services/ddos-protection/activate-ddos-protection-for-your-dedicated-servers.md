# Activate DDoS Protection for your dedicated servers

DDoS Protection is provided for a dedicated (physical) server â€” both rented from us and third-party. You can also rent a new server with protection.

1. To order protection for a rented server, <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/contact-our-technical-support" target="_blank">send the request through technical support</a>. 

**Please note**: The main IP of the server will be changed after we set up the protection. Specify in your request:

- Server ID
- OSI layers to be protected (L3-L4 or L3-L7)
- Protection mode (on-demand or always-on)
- Bandwidth
- Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)

2. To order protection for a third-party server, fill out an application at the bottom of the <a href="https://gcore.com/ddos-protection-for-servers" target="_blank">DDoS Protection</a> section of our website. Specify in the application:

- You contact details
- Location of your equipment
- Subnet of your equipment
- Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)

3. To rent a new server with the DDoS Protection, select the configuration of the server in the <a href="https://gcore.com/hosting/dedicated" target="_blank">Dedicated servers</a> section of our website and fill out an application at the bottom of the page. Specify in it:

- Server configuration
- OSI layers to be protected (L3-L4 or L3-L7)
- Protection mode (on-demand or always-on)
- Bandwidth
- Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)

## Deactivate service

To deactivate the protection, <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/contact-our-technical-support" target="_blank">write to our technical support</a>. Please note: the main IP of the server will be changed after deactivation.
