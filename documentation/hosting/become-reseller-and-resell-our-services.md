# Become a reseller and resell our services

Reselling is a way of a partnership when you purchase our servers and provide them to your customers using your own billing system.

To enter the reselling program and use special discount, you just need to <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/hosting/contact-our-technical-support" target="_blank">Contact our technical support</a> and specify the following information: 

- name of a company, link to your site;
- number of users; 
- product you would like to resell (VPS or dedicated server); 
- expected sales volume. 

After the request approval, the discount will be displayed in the Control Panel, in the section Client - Discount.
