# DNS Hosting

Welcome to the <a href="https://gcore.com/dns" target="_blank">Gcore DNS Hosting</a> documentation page! Here we explain how to use and configure Gcore’s DNS Hosting.

DNS Hosting is a service that allows you to manage domain DNS records by specifying Gcore name servers. You can balance your users on different servers depending on their location and configure network settings.

From the left-side menu, you can access in-depth documentation about DNS:

- **Overview** – how it works, non-advanced and advanced interface modes
- **Zone** – create, edit, and delete a DNS zone for the domain whose DNS records you wish to manage
- **Records** – find out how to manage different types of DNS records using non-advanced or advanced mode
- **Plugins** – use Gcore as a secondary DNS with the OctoDNS plugin, automatically issue Wildcard Let's Encrypt certificates with the Certbot plugin
- **Health Checks** – use, configuration

If you have any questions or if there is a DNS-related topic that you think we’re missing, please leave a comment and our content team will address it.
