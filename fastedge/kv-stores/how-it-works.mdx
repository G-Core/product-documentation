Edge Storage leverages a distributed key-value store architecture optimized for FastEdge's global WASM runtime. Here's what makes it unique:

### Architecture

**Co-located storage instances**: Unlike traditional CDN solutions that run data stores at regional Point-of-Presence (POP) locations, Edge Storage deploys a storage instance at every edge location where your FastEdge application runs. This means your WASM component and its data store exist in the same environment, eliminating network hops and providing single-digit millisecond read latency.

**Write-once, replicate everywhere**: When you write data through the API, it's first persisted to a central SQL database, then automatically replicated to all edge storage instances globally. This replication typically completes within 1-2 seconds.

### Performance characteristics

- **Ultra-fast reads**: Reading from Edge Storage happens locally at each edge with sub-millisecond latency since the data store runs alongside your WASM application
- **Eventual consistency for writes**: API writes take 1-2 seconds to propagate globally, making Edge Storage ideal for read-heavy workloads

### Why this approach wins

Traditional edge computing platforms place data stores at regional POP locations, forcing your application to make network calls to reach the data store. This introduces latency and potential failure points. By co-locating the storage with your WASM runtime at every edge, Edge Storage delivers:

- **Lower latency**: No network round-trips between your application and data store
- **Higher reliability**: Data access doesn't depend on cross-datacenter connectivity
- **Better performance**: Optimize for the 99% use case (reads) while accepting slightly slower writes

This architecture is perfect for frequently-read, infrequently-written data. Ideal use cases include configuration data, feature flags, content fragments, and blocklist/allowlist checks based on IP addresses, IP subnets, ASNs, and similar criteria.
