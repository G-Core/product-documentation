### What is a Sorted Set?

A Sorted Set (ZSET) stores unique members, each associated with a numeric score. Members are ordered by score, which makes ZSETs ideal for leaderboards, rankings, and time- or priority-based lists.

You can add, update, or remove members while keeping the order automatically maintained.

- Each member is unique; adding the same member updates its score.
- Scores are numeric; members are ordered by score, then lexicographically for ties.
- Membership is stored in-memory with scores, so very large sets can impact memory usage.
