FastEdge allows you to run applications in a serverless environment on Gcore's scalable CDN network. You can create the following types of FastEdge apps: 

  * **HTTP applications** : manage apps that have their own URL and are built using [FastEdge Rust SDK](https://github.com/G-Core/FastEdge-sdk-rust) or [FastEdge JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/G-Core/FastEdge-sdk-js).

  * **CDN applications** : manage apps that extend the functionality of Gcore CDN and use [Proxy-Wasm](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec) spec.
