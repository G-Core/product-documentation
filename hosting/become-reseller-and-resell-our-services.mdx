Reselling is a way of a partnership when you purchase our servers and provide them to your customers using your own billing system.

To enter the reselling program and use special discount, you just need to [Contact our technical support](/hosting/contact-our-technical-support) and specify the following information: 

  * name of a company, link to your site;
  * number of users; 
  * product you would like to resell (VPS or dedicated server); 
  * expected sales volume.



After the request approval, the discount will be displayed in the Control Panel, in the section Client - Discount.
