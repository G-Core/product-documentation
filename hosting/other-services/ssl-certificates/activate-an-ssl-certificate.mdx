## DV certificates

To activate SSL certificates of this level, you need to go by the link, which is sent in a letter to the specified e-mail after ordering a certificate. This is one of the addresses:

  * `admin@example.com`
  * `administrator@example.com`
  * `hostmaster@example.com`
  * `postmaster@example.com`
  * `webmaster@example.com`



Usually, a letter with the URL to confirm the issue of the certificate comes within 24 hours.

## OV certificates

If you ordered a certificate of OV level, a provider should check an information about your company. As a rule, these details are taken from open sources.

In case of questions during the audit of a company, you can receive additional requests from a certification center to clarify all the information.
