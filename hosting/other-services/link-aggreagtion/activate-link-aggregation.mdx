Bonding is the technology of aggregating several parallel channels in Ethernet network. The feature helps to balance server loading and increase fault tolerance. 

We set up channel aggregation using the standard LACP protocol. It is paid feature, take a look at prices [at the LACP tab](https://gcore.com/hosting/miscellaneous).

To get bonding order the service Port Channel from the Control Panel, prepare your server and then contact us via ticket to set it up.

## Server setup

## Setup example for Ubuntu 14.04

Install ifenslave package **before contacting us** :

```sh
apt-get install ifenslave​
 ```

Add "bonding" to **/etc/modules** file.

Run modprobe load bonding immediately:

```sh
modprobe bonding
 ```

Make sure it's loaded, you should see something like "bonding 147456 0":

```sh
# lsmod | grep bonding 
bonding 147456 0
 ```

## Configure LACP on the server

After LACP is ready from our side you need to configure it on the server.

Stop network services:

```sh
stop networking
 ```

Edit network interfaces settings:

```sh
vim /etc/network/interfaces
 ```

using the following example (replace em1 and em2 to your network interface names):

```
auto em1 
iface em1 inet manual 
bond-master bond0 
bond-primary em1 
 
auto em2 
iface em2 inet manual 
bond-master bond0 
 
auto bond0 
iface bond0 inet static 
 address 92.223.103.25 
 gateway 92.223.103.1 
 netmask 255.255.255.0 
 
bond-mode 4 
bond-miimon 100 
bond-lacp-rate 1 
bond-slaves em1 em2
 ```

Changes will apply after you do the following:

```sh
start networking
 ```

If there is no network connection in the bonding, reboot your server. 

You can check the bond0 status:

```sh
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
 ```

Output example:

```sh
