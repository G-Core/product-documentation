DDoS Protection is provided for a dedicated (physical) server â€” both rented from us and third-party. You can also rent a new server with protection.

  1. To order protection for a rented server, [send the request through technical support](/hosting/contact-our-technical-support).



**Please note** : The main IP of the server will be changed after we set up the protection. Specify in your request:

  * Server ID
  * OSI layers to be protected (L3-L4 or L3-L7)
  * Protection mode (on-demand or always-on)
  * Bandwidth
  * Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)


  2. To order protection for a third-party server, fill out an application at the bottom of the [DDoS Protection](https://gcore.com/ddos-protection-for-servers) section of our website. Specify in the application:


  * You contact details
  * Location of your equipment
  * Subnet of your equipment
  * Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)


  3. To rent a new server with the DDoS Protection, select the configuration of the server in the [Dedicated Servers](https://gcore.com/hosting/dedicated) section of our website and fill out an application at the bottom of the page. Specify in it:


  * Server configuration
  * OSI layers to be protected (L3-L4 or L3-L7)
  * Protection mode (on-demand or always-on)
  * Bandwidth
  * Whitelist and blacklist of IP (optional, you can send it later)
