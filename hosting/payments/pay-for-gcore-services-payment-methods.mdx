If you use a bank card to pay for our services, you can set up auto payment. Auto payment is a function that recharges your balance automatically. If you don't have enough money on your balance to pay for the service at the time of payment, the system will charge your bank card with the required amount. To configure auto payment, refer to the "[Set up auto payment](/hosting/payments/set-up-auto-payment)" article.
