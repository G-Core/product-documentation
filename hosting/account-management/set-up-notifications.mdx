If you would like to be informed about approaching end date of your server or about new support answers in tickets you can set up notifications via email in the Control Panel.

For every user you can set up the personal notifications. You should login to Control Panel as a certain user (you can read [here](/hosting/account-management/users/add-a-new-user-to-your-account) how to add a new user to your account), then in the Client section click User Settings.

Note, that this user should have an access to the User Settings section: [How to set up user rights](/hosting/account-management/users/configure-user-rights).

At the end of the page, you'll find Subscribe to Notification section and will be able to choose the notifications you need.
