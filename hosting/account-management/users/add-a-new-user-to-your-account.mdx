It is often necessary to allow access to the Control Panel to several users. To avoid credentials sharing with, for example, your site administrator or financial manager, add a new user to the account. To do this go to "Tools" - "Add new user".

Set Name and E-mail and password of the new user. The credentials can be used to log into the Control Panel. Later, the user will be able to change the password.

To see your user list go to "Client" - "Users".
