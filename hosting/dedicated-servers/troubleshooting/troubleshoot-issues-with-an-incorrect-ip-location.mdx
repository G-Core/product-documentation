All our IP addresses have the same location as the data center where you have bought the server. We recommend checking IP location via these two official services - [maxmind.com](https://maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo?pkit_lang=en) & [RIPE](https://stat.ripe.net).

Other online services update information about IP location with a delay. That's why you can see incorrect location while using such services.

If you have checked IP location via [maxmind.com](https://maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo?pkit_lang=en) or [RIPE](https://stat.ripe.net) and noticed that it shows the wrong location too, contact us via chat or ticket. Then we'll send an updating location inquiry to them.
