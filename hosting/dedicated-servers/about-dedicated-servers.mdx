Dedicated Server is a physical server for your project's tasks with an ability to use all your machine's resources and to install any software. The service is used when you need to store large amounts of data, allocate resource-intensive projects, work with applications that are incompatible with virtualization systems, and solve project tasks with specific requirements for server configuration.
