A PTR record maps an IP address to a domain name, as opposed to an A record which points a domain name to an IP address.

## What is a PTR record used for?

PTR records are normally used for outbound email servers, since incoming mail servers may not accept a message from an IP address which does not identify itself with a PTR record. A PTR record which matches the domain name from which an email has been received is one of the signals that the email should not be marked as spam.
