VNC (Virtual Network Computing) allows you to view and control a remote computer's desktop. VNC works by sending graphics data of the mouse and keyboard input between client and server applications, using the Remote Frame Buffer protocol. Using VNC console, you can connect to your VPS from the control panel.

Here's how to connect via VNC to your Virtual Server.

  1. After activating the Virtual Server, you will receive an email with instructions on how to connect to it and your login credentials. This information is also available on the control panel **Instructions** tab. Open this tab and you will find **User** and **Password**. These are exactly the credentials you need to connect to the server.
