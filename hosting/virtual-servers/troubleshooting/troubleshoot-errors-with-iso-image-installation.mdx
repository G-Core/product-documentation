**Can't upload ISO in the panel**. Check name of the file you're uploading - you should use only lowercase letters in the file extension. So, it should be «.iso», not «.ISO». Moreover, use only letters and numbers.

Check if the ISO file meets the following requirements:

  * The file size shouldn't exceed 8 GB
  * The total amount of ISO images is 3 images per account.
