As a DNS provider, we offer customers two products: [Managed DNS](https://gcore.com/dns) and [Public DNS](https://gcore.com/public-dns). Learn how DNS works in our blog post "[on DNS](https://gcore.com/learning/what-is-dns-how-does-it-work)."

## Managed DNS

Gcore Managed DNS is an authoritative DNS server for domain delegation. When delegating domains and creating a DNS zone, the following features are available:

  * [Creation of a CDN resource for the entire site](/cdn/getting-started/create-a-cdn-resource/create-a-cdn-resource-for-the-entire-site).
  * DNS records management in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://dns.gcore.com/zones) and via the [API](https://api.gcore.com/docs/dns).
  * AnycastDNS for redirecting requests to your domain to the nearest edge location.
  * [Flexible balancing to various IP addresses](/dns/dns-records/configure-weight-balancing-and-geobalancing), based on the geolocation of the user who requested the domain, metadata, or weight that you set. This includes support for EDNS Client Subnet to enhance routing accuracy.
  * [DNSSEC](/dns/getting-started-with-dnssec) for domain protection during resolving processes.
  * [Health Checks](/dns/dns-failover/configure-and-use-dns-failover) for checking the availability of IP addresses.
  * [OctoDNS](/dns/dns-plugins/use-gcore-dns-as-a-secondary-dns-with-octodns), [Certbot](/dns/dns-plugins/get-a-let-s-encrypt-certificate-with-certbot), Kubernetes, and Terraform third-party solution integrations.
  * [CNAME flattening](/dns/dns-records/specify-cname-at-root) for using a subdomain at the root.
  * [Support for HTTPS records](/dns/dns-records/what-is-an-https-record-and-how-is-it-configured).
  * [Support for IPv6 addresses](/dns/dns-records#aaaa-record).



DNS record management is available in two modes: **non-advanced** and **advanced**. Use non-advanced mode if you need to add a single DNS record without additional balancing settings. Use advanced mode if you want to add RRsets or set additional settings, such as balancing and Health Checks.

## Public DNS

Gcore Public DNS provides **free** public DNS resolvers for converting names into IP addresses. You can use Gcore Public DNS instead of the resolvers provided by your internet provider to increase resolution speed and protect your domain from substitution.
