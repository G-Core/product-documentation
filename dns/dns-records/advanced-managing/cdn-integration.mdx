If you use both Gcore DNS and Gcore CDN you can configure A/AAAA DNS record to resolve exactly to our CDN addresses. CDN integration allows you to avoid CNAME configuration and additional lookup on the end user side. Gcore DNS will resolve the record to the best possible CDN address.

To configure integration:

1\. Navigate to [DNS](https://dns.gcore.com/zones) in the Gcore Customer Portal.

2\. Click the domain name of the DNS zone where you intend to set up CDN integration.
