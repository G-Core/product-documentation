Please note that the article refers to the non-advanced mode. First, make sure that the advanced mode toggle switch is set to "off":

 If you want to configure balancing and dynamic response, use our guide on [advanced balancing](/dns/dns-records/manage-dns-records-advanced-interface-mode-with-balancing).

## Create a DNS record

1\. Navigate to [All zones](https://dns.gcore.com/zones) and select the domain zone for which you want to add records. Or, click the three-dot icon on the right and then click **Go to records**.


<Frame>![Open a DNS zone](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/dns/dns-records/manage-dns-records-non-advanced-interface-mode/dns-record-10.png)</Frame>



2\. Click **Add record**.


<Frame>![Add a record](https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/dns/dns-records/manage-dns-records-non-advanced-interface-mode/dns-record-20.png)</Frame>



A new window will appear. Perform the remaining steps there.

3\. In the "Type" section, select the type of DNS record you want to create: A, AAAA, NS, CNAME, MX, SRV, HTTPS, TXT, or CAA. Learn more in our article on [supported DNS record types](/dns/dns-records).

4\. In the "Name" field, specify the subdomain to which the record belongs. Choose from the following options:

  * Leave the field blank to add a record for the main domain (apex/naked domain; in the picture above it is `sample-test.com`).
  * Enter the name of this subdomain to add a record for a specific subdomain (for example, if you enter `one`, the record will be created for `one.sample-test.com`).
  * Enter an asterisk (*) to add a record for all subdomains at once (wildcard record).



5\. In the "TTL" field, specify the TTL (time to live) in seconds. For example, an A record has a TTL of 300. You have changed the value of this record from `1.2.3.4` to `5.6.7.8`. Within 5 minutes, when requesting your domain, users will still be sent to a server with IP `1.2.3.4` (this value will be stored in the cache of recursive DNS servers). But after 5 minutes, the DNS server will check the settings and see the new value of the A record and the DNS server will send users to the server with IP `5.6.7.8`.

6\. In the field, enter a value appropriate for your record type.
