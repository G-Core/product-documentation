The following instructions will help you set up Terraform and use it to create and manage CDN resources. 

1\. Download the appropriate Terraform package for your OS from the [official Terraform website](https://terraform.io/downloads). 

2\. Create a new folder and name it just as the downloaded package. 

3\. Unzip the Terraform archive into the new folder. 

4\. Add the directory of the unzipped Terraform archive to the `PATH` environment variable. 

5\. Create a configuration file in the Terraform folder and name it _main.tf_. 

6\. Copy the code below and paste it to the _main.tf_ file. 

```
terraform {  
  required_version = ">=0.13.0"   
  required_providers {   
    gcore = {  
      source = "G-Core/gcore"  
      version = "0.3.44"  
   }   
  }   
}   
provider gcore {   
permanent_api_token = "251$d33611b35f26d8"  
} 
```

Where:

  * 0.3.44 is the latest version of the Terraform provider indicated on the [Terraform registry page](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/G-Core/gcore/latest).
  * 251$d33611b35f26d8 is a permanent API token generated according to [Managing API tokens](/account-settings/create-use-or-delete-a-permanent-api-token) guide.



7\. Open the command-line interface, navigate to the **Terraform** folder, and run the following command: 
    
    
```
terraform init
```

This command will install Terraform and download a set of modules to work with our CDN. The following response will appear:


<Frame>![response ](/images/docs/cdn/grafana-terraform/manage-a-cdn-resource-with-terraform/image_1734.png)</Frame>



This response means Terraform was successfully downloaded and installed, you can start working with it.
