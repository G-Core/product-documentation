**Note** : Your SSL certificate should be issued for the [custom domain of your CDN resource](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/create-and-set-a-custom-domain-for-the-content-delivery-via-cdn), e.g., _cdn.example.com_. You can use a wildcard certificate, which allows you to protect all subdomains (_*.example.com_).

## How to upload an SSL certificate to your account

1\. Go to [SSL certificates](https://cdn.gcore.com/ssl/) and click **Add SSL certificate**.

A new page will open.


<Frame>![new page will open](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/ssl-certificate-data.png)</Frame>



2\. Enter the following details of the certificate that you purchased from the Certificate Authority:

  * The SSL certificate name, which can be found in the Gcore Customer Portal 
  * Certificate chain (personal certificate, intermediate CA, root CA) in the [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail)
  * Private key



For help inserting the certificate chain and key contents, [explore our guide](/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate#how-to-insert-an-ssl-chain-and-a-key-correctly).

3\. Uncheck the box if the certificate is not signed by the trusted CA.

4\. Click **Create SSL Certificate**.

That's it. The certificate will be added to the list of certificates in the [SSL Certificates](https://cdn.gcore.com/ssl/) section.

**Note** : Attach the entry to the related CDN resource after uploading your SSL certificate data. 

### How to insert an SSL chain and a key correctly

1\. Open the certificate file in PEM format (.pem, .crt, or .cer) using a text editor like Notepad.

2\. Copy and paste the certificate chain in this order: personal certificate, intermediate CA, root CA.

3\. All the contents of the certificate must be inserted into the **Certificate** field, including the tags `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`.

4\. The certificate chain must be inserted without blank lines. Here's an example of how it should look:


<Frame>![certificate chain](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-4.png)</Frame>



5\. Add a new line at the end of the certificate chain.


<Frame>![new line at the end of the certificate chain](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-5.png)</Frame>



6\. Open the private key file (.key) using a text editor.

7\. Copy and paste all of its contents into the **Private key** field, including the tags `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

## How to attach the SSL certificate to the CDN resource

You can attach the SSL certificate to your CDN resource either:

  * During CDN resource creation
  * To an existing CDN resource



### Method 1: Add SSL certificate during CDN resource creation

1\. Follow steps 1–3 of the guide [Create a CDN resource for static assets only](/cdn/getting-started/create-a-cdn-resource/create-a-cdn-resource-for-only-static-files) until the "Custom domain" field is filled in.


<Frame>![Create a CDN resource](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-6.png)</Frame>



2\. In the **Custom domain** section, enter your desired custom domain name—e.g., _cdn.example.com_ —for your CDN resource.

3\. In the **SSL** section, turn on the toggle for **Enable HTTPS** and select **Add or select your own SSL certificate**.

4\. If you've already [uploaded the SSL certificate to your account](/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate#how-to-upload-an-ssl-certificate-to-your-account), select the certificate from the list and continue the CDN resource creation.

5\. Continue with the creation of your CDN resource.


<Accordion title="If you haven't uploaded the SSL certificate">

### Method 2: Add SSL certificate for an existing CDN resource

1\. Select the resource you want to configure in the [CDN resources](https://cdn.gcore.com/resources/list) section.

## Certificate management

### SSL certificates overview

The certificate will be displayed in the [SSL certificates](https://cdn.gcore.com/ssl/list) section in the Gcore Customer Portal. This page contains a table that lists your personal certificates and associated information, such as the ID, name, CDN resources connected to the certificate, and expiration date.


<Frame>![Renew an SSL certificate](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-11.png)</Frame>



### Renew an SSL certificate

There is no way to change a certificate's data once the certificate has been added. When the certificate is nearing its expiration date, follow these steps:

1\. Go to the [SSL Certificates](https://cdn.gcore.com/ssl/list) page and [upload a new certificate](/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate#how-to-upload-an-ssl-certificate-to-your-account).

2\. Go to the settings of the CDN resource you want to configure.

3\. Select the new certificate from the dropdown menu in the SSL section.

4\. Click **Save changes** and allow at least fifteen minutes for the changes to take effect.

5\. To verify that the SSL certificate has been correctly installed and bound to the resource, enter your CNAME into the browser (e.g., `https://example.com`). Click the lock icon in the address bar, navigate to **Connection is secure**, and click **Certificate is valid**.


<Frame>![verify that the SSL certificate](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-12.png)</Frame>



Compare the displayed certificate data with the new certificate data you just added. If the settings match, you can safely [delete the old certificate](/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate#delete-an-ssl-certificate) from the SSL certificates page.

**Note** : Delete the old certificate only after ensuring your content is delivered using the new certificate. If you delete the old certificate too soon, content delivery will be interrupted.

### SSL certificate expiration notifications

When your added certificates are about to expire, a notification is displayed in your account and is sent to the email addresses of the administrator and engineer. Users are notified by email:

  * Fourteen days before the certificate expires
  * Seven days before the certificate expires
  * On the day of the certificate's expiration



In addition, when you log in to your account during the fourteen days before certificate expiration or any time after that, you will see a reminder. The [SSL certificates](https://cdn.gcore.com/ssl/list) in the side panel will also be marked with an exclamation point if there are expired certificates or certificates that will expire within the next fourteen days.


<Frame>![SSL certificates](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-13.png)</Frame>



In the certificates, warning signs will appear next to the specific certificates that need attention.

If the certificate has already expired, a red exclamation point will be shown.


<Frame>![certificate has already expired](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-14.png)</Frame>



If the certificate is due to expire in fourteen days or fewer, a yellow warning triangle will be shown.


<Frame>![certificate is due to expire](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-15.png)</Frame>



### Delete an SSL certificate

To delete a certificate, click the three dots next to the certificate, then click **Delete**.


<Frame>![Delete an SSL certificate](/images/docs/cdn/ssl-certificates/configure-your-own-ssl-certificate/own-ssl-16.png)</Frame>



**Note** : It is not possible to delete certificates that are currently in use by a CDN resource. If you want to delete such a certificate, you must first unattach it. To do so, open the SSL section in the CDN resource settings and turn off the **Enable HTTPS option**.
