title: Logs uploader (near real-time)
---

Logs Uploader is a feature that enables an automatic export of CDN resource logs to your storage in near real-time. 

Exported logs contain information about user requests sent to cache servers and pre-cache servers (if you have the [Origin shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) feature enabled).

**Info**

This is a paid feature. To activate Logs Uploader, [contact the Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com).

## Logs uploader settings

In this section, you can find general information about log settings, statuses, and how to configure logs exporting for different storage types.

### Log format example
    
    
```
"$remote_addr" "-" "$remote_user" "[$time_local]" "$request" "$status"  
"$body_bytes_sent" "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$bytes_sent"  
"$edgename" "$scheme" "$host" "$request_time"  
"$upstream_response_time" "$request_length" "$http_range" "[$responding_node]"  
"$upstream_cache_status" "$upstream_response_length" "$upstream_addr"  
"$gcdn_api_client_id" "$gcdn_api_resource_id" "$uid_got" "$uid_set"  
"$geoip_country_code" "$geoip_city" "$shield_type" "$server_addr" "$server_port"  
"$upstream_status" "-" "$upstream_connect_time" "$upstream_header_time"  
"$shard_addr" "$geoip2_data_asnumber" "$connection" "$connection_requests"  
"$http_traceparent" "$http_x_forwarded_proto" "$gcdn_internal_status_code" "$ssl_cipher"  
"$ssl_session_id" "$ssl_session_reused" "$sent_http_content_type" "$tcpinfo_rtt" 
"$server_country_code" "$gcdn_tcpinfo_snd_cwnd" "$gcdn_tcpinfo_total_retrans" "$gcdn_rule_id" 
```

It's OK if you find a field that's not listed in the example. We occasionally add new fields to the end of the line. If some fields are added to logs, you'll receive an email about the update. 

### Log fields

The following table contains a complete list of available log fields. Fields formatted in italics relate to our internal CDN system, so you can ignore them. 

You can check other fieldsâ€”they can be helpful for traffic analysis or statistics.

## Configure logs for export

You can enable and set up the **Logs uploader** feature in the Gcore Customer Portal on the [Gcore CDN page](https://gcore.com/cdn). 

To access log settings, navigate to **Logs** > **Logs uploader** and configure the feature as described in the following steps.

## Step 1. Create Policy

Policies - rules that define which logs are uploaded and how they are uploaded. To create a policy, navigate to the "Policies" tab and click the "Add policy" button. 

### Name your policy

Each created policy must have a name. A maximum of 255 characters in this field is allowed.

### (Optional). Include empty logs

Keep the **Do not send empty logs** option selected if you don't want to receive empty logs. Otherwise, uncheck it. 

### (Optional). Enable origin shielding

If you are using the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding" target="_blank">origin shielding</a> feature, youâ€™ll see the **Add logs from origin shielding** checkbox when configuring the Logs uploader. 

We recommend that you select this option as it ensures that the logs report will include both requests to cache services and requests to the pre-cache server. Thus, youâ€™ll receive more detailed information on resource usage. To include these logs, select the checkbox to enable **Include logs from origin shielding**.

<alert-element type="tip" title="Tip">
 
If you donâ€™t see the origin shielding option on the **Logs uploader** page, this feature is not activated for your account. For details on how to activate origin shielding, check our <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding" target="_blank">dedicated guide</a>. 
 
</alert-element>

### Select log fields

Choose which <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/cdn/logs/logs-uploader#log-fields" target="_blank">log fields</a> you want to include in the exported report. By default, all fields are selected. Additionally, fields can be re-ordered via the "Edit order" button.

### (Optional) Change log fields delimiter

Here, the field delimiter for logs can be changed - the default delimiter is " , but it can be changed to any string up to 10 characters.

### (Optional) Change log fields separator

The default separator for the log fields is space (" "), but it can be changed to any string up to 10 characters.

### (Optional) Specify log file name format

Template for the path and name of the log file to be uploaded. Supports variables (e.g., {{TIMESTAMP}}). By default, the log format will be "{{YYYY}}/{{MM}}/{{DD}}/{{HH}}/{{mm}}/{{ss}}/{{HOST}}_{{CNAME}}_access.log.gz". 

<alert-element type="tip" title="Tip">

Ensure this field includes: {{CNAME}}, {{HOST}}, at least one of {{TIMESTAMP}}, {{UUID}}, a valid combination of {{YYYY}}, {{MM}}, {{DD}}, {{HH}}, {{mm}}, {{ss}} - otherwise the log files will overwrite each other and you will see an error.

</alert-element>

### (Optional) Specify time interval for sending logs

By default, the Logs uploader will send entries every 60 minutes, but any time interval from 5 to 60 minutes can be specified.

### (Optional) Specify log file size limit

The maximum log file limit in MB is not specified by default, which means that logs will be sent according to the selected time interval. However, a threshold in MB (minimum 100 MB) can be specified, indicating that logs will be sent after the log file reaches the threshold. Log size limit applies before compression; the actual file size delivered to your endpoint will be compressed, hence much smaller.

Click **Add policy** to create the policy with all specified settings.

## Step 2. Create Target

Targets - destinations where logs are uploaded. To create a target, navigate to the "Targets" tab and click the "Add target" button. 

Each created target must have a name. A maximum of 255 characters in this field is allowed. After filling in the target name, select one of the Storage providers.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Gcore">
    Follow these instructions to export logs to <a href="https://gcore.com/storage" target="_blank">Gcore Object Storage</a>: 

    1\. In the **Storage provider**, select **Gcore** or **Other**; 

    2\. Specify a hostname â€” a name thatâ€™s assigned to a storage server within a network and is used instead of an IP address. In youâ€™re using Gcore Storage, you can find your hostname in the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage#object-storage" target="_blank">storage details section</a>; 

    3\. Provide your access key ID and secret access key. You can find this information in the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/storage/request-content-directly-from-the-storage" target="_blank">Details of the storage</a>; 

    4\. Choose a storage region. Check the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/storage/manage-object-storage/s3-service-urls-and-default-region-names" target="_blank>official Gcore S3 documentation</a> for default region names;

    5\. Specify the name of a bucket where you want to export CDN logs; 

    6\. (Optional). Enter a folder name if you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket; 

    7\. Click **Add target** to create the target.

    3\. Choose a storage region. While the region is often determined automatically, we recommend specifying it to ensure that your logs are exported successfully; 

    4\. Specify the name of a bucket where you want to export CDN logs; 

    5\. (Optional). Enter a folder name if you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket; 

    6\. Click **Add target** to create the target.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other">

    6\. (Optional). Enter a folder name if you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket; 

    7\. Click **Add target** to create the target.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3. Create Configuration

Configurations - combinations of the Logs uploader policies, targets, and resources to which they are applied. To create a configuration, navigate to the "Configurations" tab and click the "Add configuration" button. 

By default, all newly created configurations are in the enabled state. To change this, turn off the "Enable configuration" switch. It can be enabled later via the Configurations tab. 

Select one of the following options: whether the configuration will be applied to all CDN resources (including new ones) or to the selected CDN resources only.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="All Resources">
    1\. Enter a configuration name. A maximum of 255 characters in this field is allowed;

    2\. Select a policy from the dropdown;

    3\. Select a target from the dropdown;

    4\. Click **Add configuration** to create a configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specific Resource(s)">
    1\. Enter a configuration name. A maximum of 255 characters in this field is allowed;

    2\. (Optional) Select CDN resources to which the configuration will be applied;

    3\. Select a policy from the dropdown;

    4\. Select a target from the dropdown;

    5\. Click **Add configuration** to create a configuration.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Logs uploader

After configuring the Logs uploader policy, target, and configuration for the first time, they can be edited and deleted from the corresponding tabs. The current limit for each entity is set to 10 per account. If you need an increase of the limit, [contact the Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com).

<alert-element type="tip" title="Tip">

The target and policy linked to the active configuration cannot be deleted; you first need to unlink it from the configuration - otherwise, the log files can be lost, so you will see an error upon deleting such a target or policy.

</alert-element>

## How near-real-time log exporting works

Logs are archived and exported to your endpoint according to the set time interval. After creating or changing the target, a test file will be sent to the provided storage to validate the availability of your storage.
