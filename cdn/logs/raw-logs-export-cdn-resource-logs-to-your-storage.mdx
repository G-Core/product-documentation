Raw Logs is an option that enables an automatic export of CDN resource logs to your storage. Logs contain information about user requests sent to cache servers and pre-cache servers (if the [Origin Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) is enabled).

 <Info>
**Info**

This is a paid feature. To activate Raw Logs, [contact the Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com). After activation, enable Raw Logs in the Gcore Customer Portal and configure export to S3, FTP, or SFTP storage.

## Raw logs settings

In this section, you can find general information about log settings, overview of log statuses, and details on how Raw Logs are exported and calculated. 

### Add logs from origin shielding

If you are using the [Origin Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) feature, you'll see the **Add logs from origin shielding** checkbox when configuring logs. We recommend that you select this option as it ensures that the logs report will include both requests to cache services and requests to the pre-cache server. Thus, you'll receive more detailed information on resource usage. 

When setting up Raw Logs, select the checkbox to enable **Add logs from origin shielding**.

 <Tip>
**Tip**

If you don't see the Origin Shielding option on the Raw Logs page, this feature is not activated for your account. For details on how to activate Origin Shielding, check our [dedicated guide](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding).
</Tip>

### Raw logs statuses

You can check the status of the Raw Logs in the Gcore Customer Portal: 

  * **Pending** : A status for the time interval between the connection to storage and the first log export. 

  * **OK** : Logs are exported from at least one CDN server. 

  * **Failed** : An error occurred while connecting to a storage, or the service failed to export logs within 24 hours. 

  * **Pause** : The Raw Logs feature is paused.




### Export time intervals

Logs are exported at the end of each hour. If you activate Raw Logs at 00:30, the first logs will be exported between 00:45 and 01:00 and the next ones—between 01:45 and 02:00. 

If CDN servers are not requested and you didn't select the **Do not send empty logs** checkbox when configuring Raw Logs, an empty log file (± 20 bytes) will be sent to your storage. 

### Log traffic calculation

Logs can generate various types of analytics, such as delivered traffic. To understand what the totals mean, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the formulas for calculating logs. For details about CDN reports, check out the [View statistics on CDN resources](/cdn/view-statistics-of-a-cdn-resource) guide. 

The formula for calculating traffic depends on whether you've selected the **Add logs from origin shielding** option for Raw Logs. 

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="If Origin Shielding is disabled">
If this feature is disabled, the formula will look like this: 

```
total_bytes = upstream_bytes + sent_bytes 
```

Where:

 * `upstream_bytes` are equal to the `$upstream_response_length` log field and refer to the response length from an origin in bytes
 * `sent_bytes` are equal to the `$bytes_sent` log field and refer to the number of bytes sent to a user from the edge (cache) servers

For example, if `$upstream_response_length` is 10485760 (bytes) and `$bytes_sent` is 1514848 (bytes), the final value in the Raw logs report will be 12,000,608 (bytes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="If Origin Shielding is enabled">
If this feature is enabled, the formula will look like this: 

```
total_bytes = upstream_bytes + sent_bytes + shield_bytes
```

Where:

 * `upstream_bytes` are equal to the `$upstream_response_length` log field and refer to the response length from an origin in bytes
 * `sent_bytes` are equal to the `$bytes_sent` log field and refer to the number of bytes sent to a user from the edge (cache) servers
 * `shield_bytes` are equal to the `$bytes_sent` log field and refer to the number of bytes sent to a user from the pre-cache server
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


<Info>
**Info**

The final value of log data may differ slightly from the billing statistics as there may be cases where not all logs are received, such as: * You are using the [Origin Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) feature but didn't select the **Add logs from origin shieldin** g option. * You have a rate limit set on your storage side, and when CDN started generating logs, some logs weren't downloaded because of the rate limitation.

    7\. Specify your access key ID. In your Amazon personal account, it's called "AWS access key ID". For details on how to find your key ID, check the [official Amazon guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html). An access key ID and secret access key are required to configure log export to your storage.

    8\. Specify your secret access key. In your Amazon account, it's called "AWS secret access key". For details on how to find your access key, check the [official Amazon guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html). 

    9\. (Optional) Enter your AWS region—the location of a server where your storage is hosted. For most storage types, the region is determined automatically, so you might leave the field empty. However, we recommend specifying the region to ensure that your logs are exported successfully. 

    10\. Choose how to organize your storage: put logs of all CDN resources into one bucket or use separate buckets for each CDN resource.

    11\. Specify buckets for log export. Make sure to indicate an existing bucket. Otherwise, your logs won't be exported.  
    Enter a folder name if you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket.

    7\. Specify a hostname—a name that's assigned to a storage server within a network and is used instead of an IP address. If you use [Gcore Object Storage](https://gcore.com/storage), you can find its access key ID in your personal account in the [Hostname](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage#s3) field.

    8\. Specify your access key ID. Along with a secret access key, it's required to configure log export to your storage. If you use [Gcore Object Storage](https://gcore.com/storage), you can find its access key ID in your personal account in the [Access key](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage#s3) field.

    9\. Specify your secret access key. If you use [Gcore Object Storage](https://gcore.com/storage), you can find its secret access key in your personal account in the [Secret key](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage#s3) field.

    10\. Specify a bucket hostname—a bucket ID that's used by your Object storage system in the `{bucket_name}.{hostname}` format. It's required to ensure that logs are exported to the correct bucket within a storage. A bucket hostname of the Gcore storage looks as follows: `{bucket name}.{hostname from step 3}`. For example: `examplename.s-ed1.cloud.gcore.lu`. 

    11\. (Optional) Specify a regio—location ID of a server where your storage is hosted. For some storage types, the region is determined automatically, so you can leave the field empty. 

    <Info>
    **Info**

    If you use Gcore Object Storage, you must specify the location ID. You can find it in the [Details of the storage](/storage/request-content-directly-from-the-storage). Your location ID is a part of your hostname to the first dot.
    </Info>

    12\. Choose how to organize storage: put logs of all CDN resources into one bucket or use separate buckets for each CDN resource. 

    13\. Specify buckets for log export. Make sure to indicate an existing bucket. Otherwise, your logs won't be exported. If you want to export logs to a specific folder within a bucket, specify the folder name.

## Export logs to FTP or SFTP storage

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to **CDN** > **Logs**. 

2\. Enable the **Receive Raw Logs** toggle to open log settings. 

3\. Keep the **Do not send empty logs** option selected if you don't want to receive empty logs. Otherwise, uncheck it. 

4\. If you use our [Origin Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) feature, you'll see a checkbox **Add logs from origin shielding**. Select the checkbox to receive logs from both edge servers and pre-cache shielding servers. 

5\. Select to receive logs via SFTP. 


<Frame>![Raw logs settings for SFTP storage](/images/docs/cdn/logs/raw-logs-export-cdn-resource-logs-to-your-storage/export-logs-from-sftp-1.png)</Frame>



6\. Specify a hostname—a name that's assigned to a storage server within a network and is used instead of an IP address. If you use Gcore SFTP Storage, you can find its hostname in the [Details of the storage](/storage/request-content-directly-from-the-storage) in the [Hostname field](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage#sftp). It looks as follows: `ams.origin.gcdn.co`.

<Warning>
**Warning**

You need to specify an FTP or SFTP storage port after the hostname. For example: `ams.origin.gcore.co:2200`. Otherwise, you'll get the "Wrong connection settings error" and won't be able to connect to the storage.
</Warning>

7\. Specify a username you use to log in to the storage. If you use Gcore SFTP storage, you can find the username in the [Details of your storage](/storage/request-content-directly-from-the-storage) in the [Storage/User name](/storage/create-an-s3-or-sftp-storage#sftp) field.

8\. Enter the password you use to authenticate to the storage. 

9\. Specify a folder for export. If you use Gcore SFTP storage, specify the root (home) folder where other folders originate from. You can find its name in the [Details of your storage](/storage/request-content-directly-from-the-storage) at the end of the **Upload path** field.

If you use an SFTP storage from another provider, clarify whether a root folder that includes other folders is created by default. If not, leave the field empty. If yes, specify a folder name.

<Info>
**Info**

If you're using the Gcore SFTP storage, you won't be able to write to the home folder. It only receives logs and can't be manually modified.
</Info>

10\. Choose how to organize the storage: put logs of all CDN resources into one folder or use separate folders for each CDN resource. Then, specify a folder name. If you specify a non-existent folder, logs will be exported to a root folder.

11\. (Optional) Specify the folder name where logs will be stored. If you specify a non-existent folder, logs will be exported to a root folder. For Gcore SFTP storage, you can only specify the default **htdocs** folder.

12\. Click **Save changes**.

You've successfully configured Raw Logs export to FTP or SFTP storage.

## Deactivate raw logs

To stop Raw Logs delivery, disable the **Receive Raw Logs** toggle. 

If you disable the logs, your settings will be saved. You can always activate the same configuration by enabling the Receive Raw Logs toggle again. 

If you made any changes to the configuration, click Discard changes to cancel any changes made during the editing process.
