With the Gcore cdn-stats plugin in Grafana, you can display the CDN statistics by:

  * **Total Traffic,** which is total traffic volume, consisting of traffic from origin to CDN or [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) \+ from [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) to CDN + from CDN to users;
  * **Byte cache Hit Ratio,** which is the share of cached traffic, calculated using the formula: 1-(traffic from the origin to the CDN or [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding)/traffic from the CDN to users);
  * **Edges Traffic,** which is traffic from CDN, consisting of traffic from [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) to CDN + from CDN to users;
  * **Shield Traffic,** which is traffic from [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) to CDN;
  * **Origin Traffic,** which is traffic from the origin, consisting of traffic from the origin to the CDN or from the origin to the [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding);
  * **Total Requests,** which is the number of requests to the CDN;
  * **2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx Responses,** which is the number of 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx responses;
  * **Bandwidth,** which is bandwidth, calculated based on traffic from the origin to the CDN or [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) \+ from [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) to CDN + from CDN to users;
  * **Cache Hit Ratio,** which is the share of sending cached content, consisting of responses with cached content / requests to CDN;
  * **Shield traffic ratio** is the efficiency of the [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding): how much more traffic is sent from the [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) than from the origin, calculated using the formula: (traffic from the [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) to the CDN - traffic from the origin to the [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding)) / traffic from the [Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) to the CDN;



You can group metrics by the following parameters:

  * **Clients** is for clients;
  * **Resource** is for CDN resources;
  * **Region** is for regions;
  * **Country** is for countries;
  * **Data** is for data centers;
  * **Vhost** is for a personal domain.



**Note** : The plugin is designed for Grafana version 7.0 and higher.

To configure CDN statistics in Grafana, you need to:

  * Use Grafana version 7.0 and higher.



Video instructions of the steps:

## Download and install the plugin

[Download](https://github.com/G-Core/cdn-stats-datasource-plugin/releases) the gcore-cdn-stats-datasource-1.0.8.zip file with the latest version of the plugin in GitHub.

**Note** : The numbers (1.0.8) in the file name indicate the plugin version and may differ depending on updates.

Unzip the archive to the Grafana plugin folder. By default, this is the _Grafana\grafana\data\plugins_ installation folder.

[Restart](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/restart-grafana) and [log](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/getting-started/#step-2-log-in) in to Grafana.

Click the gear icon in the menu to open the "Configuration" section, select "Data Sources".

## Configure the Dashboard

Click on the **+** in the menu to open the "Create" section, select "Dashboard" to add a new dashboard.


<Frame>![Configure the Dashboard](/images/docs/cdn/grafana-terraform/view-cdn-statistics-in-grafana/dashboard.png)</Frame>



In the next window, click "Add an empty panel" to create a new panel.


<Frame>![Add an empty pane](/images/docs/cdn/grafana-terraform/view-cdn-statistics-in-grafana/add_panel.png)</Frame>


Make sure that "cdn-stats" is set as the data source in the Query section.


<Frame>![query.png](/images/docs/cdn/grafana-terraform/view-cdn-statistics-in-grafana/query.png)</Frame>



Select the necessary metric, granularity, and grouping (you can select several).


<Frame>![Select the necessary metric,](/images/docs/cdn/grafana-terraform/view-cdn-statistics-in-grafana/query_props_1.png)</Frame>



The "Legend" field displays the values of the Group by field and the name of the metric by default:


<Frame>![Legend](/images/docs/cdn/grafana-terraform/view-cdn-statistics-in-grafana/grafa.jpg)</Frame>



You can customize the output of legend data.

Set a name for the metric and in brackets `{{}}` set the parameters specified in the Group by field.

For example, for the settings above, you can set the following format: Traffic quantity â€” `{{resource}}`.
