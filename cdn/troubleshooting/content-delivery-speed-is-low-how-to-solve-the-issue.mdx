Revise your origin to find errors or misconfigurations that may affect the content delivery speed. Contact your hosting provider or server administrator for help in the case analysis. 

## Check the delivery speed from a CDN-resource and an origin server

1\. Measure the content delivery speed from both a CDN-resource and an origin server using:

  * DevTools (F12->Network tab->F5).
  * Online-services. Consider network settings and location which are chosen for the speed test. 
  * wget –S + static file URL.

```
wget -S testsupport.cdn.com/files/test.jpg

2\. Compare the delivery speed from CDN and the origin server. 

3\. If the analysis confirmed issues with content delivery speed from CDN, [revise CDN-resource's settings](/cdn/troubleshooting/content-delivery-speed-is-low-how-to-solve-the-issue#cdn-resources-settings-checking).

## CDN-resource's settings checking

1\. Make sure that you don't use a VPN or proxy.   
VPN affects the CDN Geobalancing and you may receive content from a not optimal edge with lower speed. 

2\. Make sure that content is being cached. The cache rate is presented by [Cache Hit Ratio report](/cdn/view-statistics-of-a-cdn-resource). If you noticed that the cache rate is low, use our [instructions](/cdn/troubleshooting/cache-percentage-is-low-how-to-solve-the-issue) to analyze and solve this issue. 

3\. If an issue with content delivery speed occurs with large files, we recommend you to use [Large files delivery optimization](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/optimize-large-file-delivery) and consider content [compression on CDN](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/compression/configure-gzip-and-brotli-compression) or the origin server. 

## Diagnostic information for technical support

If you revised your CDN resource's settings but are still unsatisfied with the download speed, contact [technical support](mailto:support@gcore.com) and provide the following information:

  * File URL
  * Follow the link `http://iam.gcdn.co/info`, copy all information from the page or save a screenshot. 
  * Follow the try speed test link, click on the Start button, save the result, and add it to the ticket.

  * Wget –S output for the URL from your CDN-resource.
  * Open a file or a web-page and save a [HAR file](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/?lang=en).
