**Check whether the[rules](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/rules-for-particular-files/create-a-rule-manually-or-from-a-template-to-configure-settings-for-particular-files) you created overlap the path "/.well-known/acme-challenge/".** This is the path for issuing a certificate, in many cases, such a rule (for example, with the path "/.*") does not allow issuing the certificate. Disable the rule, get the certificate, and enable the rule again.

You can check whether the rule blocks the certificate issuance path using [this service](https://regex101.com/r/Hy9bKy/1).
