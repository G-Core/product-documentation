Introducing our Dedicated IP feature, designed to provide a solution for customers with sensitive content who may require a secure and exclusive IP address.
With dedicated IPs or subnets, you can ensure that your content remains separate from others, reducing the risk of any potential issues that may arise from shared IP networks.

By offering dedicated IPs, we aim to meet the needs of customers looking to enhance their security and have greater control over their online presence.

If you are interested in using this feature, please reach out to our support team.
