sidebarTitle: Use stale cache if origin is unavailable

The option allows serving stale cached content in case of the following errors: error (network or connectivity issues), timeout, invalid_header, updating (cache updating),http_500, http_502, http_503, http_504, http_403, http_404, http_429.

HTTP response for the stale content will contain the header X-Cache: Stale. CDN will check origin availability with each user's request. As soon as the origin becomes available, fresh files will be cached and served. If the origin is unavailable for a long time, CDN will send Stale content until origin becomes available. 

Please, note that when the site is unavailable, the CDN cache may have not enough content for a correct page display. Situations, when a user will not be able to see some images, style sheets, or other static content, are possible.

To manage this option go to your Resource Advanced Settings, find the **Cache** section and click **Always online**. You can enable the toggle and choose error codes for which a CDN serves stale content.
