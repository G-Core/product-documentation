sidebarTitle: Connection and read timeouts

Custom connection and read timeouts are analogous features that let you specify how long Gcore edge nodes should wait when connecting to your origin server.

  * A custom connection timeout sets the duration allowed for establishing a connection.

  * A custom read timeout specifies the time allowed for receiving a response from your origin server. This timeout applies only between two successive read operations, not for the entire response transmission.




When designated timeouts are exceeded, users receive a "504 Gateway Timeout" error. 

## Configure custom timeouts

1\. In the Gcore Customer Portal, navigate to [CDN](https://portal.gcore.com/cdn/resources/list).


<Frame>![CDN page with a list of CDN resources](/images/docs/cdn/getting-started/timeouts/cdn-resources.png)</Frame>



2\. Click the CNAME of the required CDN resource to open **Resource settings**.

A new page will open. Perform the remaining steps there.

3\. Click **General** to open nested features.

4\. Click **Custom connection timeout** or **Custom read timeout**, depending on your task. 

5\. Enable the **Customize connection timeout** or **Customize read timeout** toggle correspondingly.

6\. Specify the desired value in the corresponding field. You can configure either feature individually or both at once. Values should be less than default Gcore values: `<5 seconds` for connection timeout and `<30 seconds` for read timeout. Learn more in our [guide to CDN timeouts](/cdn/getting-started/cdn-timeouts).

**Info**

If you're on the "Enterprise" plan, you have more flexibility in changing the default timeout values. To increase the connection timeout to over 5 seconds and read timeout to over 30 seconds, [contact our Support team](mailto:support@gcore.com).
