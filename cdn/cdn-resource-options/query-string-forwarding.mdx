## Option setting

The "Query String Forwarding" option allows you to control the forwarding of parameters from main request to any nested ones. 
Mainly used for HLS streaming, for passing secure token hash from main manifest(playlist), to playlists (different quality for example) and chunks. 

To configure the Query String Forwarding via the Gcore Customer Portal:

1\. Go to CDN and select the CDN resource you want to configure.

2\. In the sidebar, under the "Content" section, click **Query String Forwarding**.


This option has 2 input fields.

- Forward from files type "This field specifies playlist file types, such as HLS and DASH, for extracting and forwarding parameters to referenced media chunks."
- Forward to files types "This field specifies the media chunk file types that receive parameters from playlist files, ensuring streaming session integrity."

Typically, you would add ".m3u8" extension in the first field, while second one would contain ".ts". (Extensions may differ depending on your needs)
