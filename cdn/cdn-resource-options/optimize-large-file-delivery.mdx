We recommend using the Large File Delivery Optimization feature if you are serving content larger than 10 MB. With this option enabled, Gcore CDN will make range requests to the origin to retrieve 10 MB chunks of content. These chunks are then collected in the cache, and once the CDN has the necessary portions of the requested content, the response is assembled and returned to the end user.

A range request includes the _Range_ HTTP header to indicate the byte or part of the content to be returned. For example, if the request has a _Range: bytes=123537047-123545047_ header, the CDN will request a 10 MB chunk from the origin (byte range 115343360-125829119), cache this chunk, and serve the requested range (123537047-123545047) to the end user.

For this option to work, the origin server must support range requests.

## Configuration guidelines

Large File Delivery Optimization can be configured in the Resource Settings and Rules. Review the following requirements and recommendations before configuring the option:

  * The origin server must support HTTP Range Requests.
  * The _Content-Length_ and _Etag_ headers must be consistent across the origin.
  * Large File Delivery Optimization will be applied to all contents in the CDN resource, which could lead to an increased load on the origin. Therefore, consider activating [Origin Shielding](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/enable-and-configure-origin-shielding) before using this feature, or make any updates during off-peak hours.
  * Remember to [purge the resource cache](/cdn/clear-cdn-resource-cache-by-url-pattern-or-all) after enabling Large File Delivery Optimization.
  * Large File Delivery Optimization cannot be used in conjunction with [Fetch Compressed](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/compression/configure-fetch-compression), [Gzip Compression](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/compression/configure-gzip-and-brotli-compression#gzip), and [Brotli Compression](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/compression/configure-gzip-and-brotli-compression#brotli) within the Resource Settings or within the same rule.
