sidebarTitle: Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS

**Note** : only one redirect option can be enabled on a CDN resource. 

You can redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS via API (more info in the [API documentation](https://api.gcore.com/docs/cdn#tag/SSL-Certificates)) or in the Gcore Customer Portal. 

To enable the redirect option in the Gcore Customer Portal, go to the CDN resource settings: 

1\. Get a free Let's Encrypt certificate or add your SSL certificate in the General -> SSL section and save changes. More info in the guide "[Add an SSL certificate to deliver content over HTTPS](/cdn/ssl-certificates/add-an-ssl-certificate-to-deliver-content-over-https)".

2\. Go to the "Access" section, enable the "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" option and save changes.

The error "_You cannot enable redirect HTTP to HTTPS when HTTPS is disabled. Please enable HTTPS and add SSL certificate first_ " means that you didn't add a certificate or that the issuing of a Let's Encrypt certificate for your account wasn't completed. As usual it takes about 15 minutes.
