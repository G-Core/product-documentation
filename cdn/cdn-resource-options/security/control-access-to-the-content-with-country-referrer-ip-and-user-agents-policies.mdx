## Referrer access policy

Referrer access policy is a restriction to publish the links to content on your site on other sites. To enable the option navigate to CDN resources, click Settings of the resource, choose the Advanced Settings tab, in the Access (Security) click Add policy and find Referrer access policy. 

By default, there are no restrictions by referrer to your CDN resource. You can set up allow or block Policy.

### Allow referrer policy

Specify domains to which you would like to block access.

  * `www.domain.com` if you want to block access to the specific domain
  * `*.domain.com` if you want to block access to all subdomains of domain.com



When users request data from specified domains, they will get the denial of access.

4\. Set one or more user agents in the **User-Agent** select box. Accepted values are:

  * **Empty value.** This appears as an option in the select box. Select this value to allow or block incoming requests that do not have a User-Agent header.

### Set via the API

To set the user agents using the API, the request must include the `user_agent_acl` object. The following is a sample code for the object:
    
```json
"options": {  
    "user_agent_acl": {  
       "enabled": true,  
       "policy_type": "allow",  
       "excepted_values": [  
          "",  
          "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/104.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"  
      ]  
   }  
}
```


#### Request properties

The `user_agent_acl` object passes the following information:

**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
_enabled_ | This property indicates whether to enable the User Agents Policy.<br/>Possible values:<br/>- true enables the option<br/>- false disables the option
_policy_type_ | This property indicates the action to apply to the matching request.<br/>Possible values: <br/>- allow allows the request<br/>- deny blocks the request
_excepted_values_ | This property is an array of user agents to allow or block. The array must contain at least 1 item.<br/>Possible values:<br/>- two double quotation marks without a space in-between ("") represents the _empty value_<br/>- a string that represents the user agent, with a maximum length of 255 characters; if you need to increase this limit, you can contact our [support team](mailto:support@gcore.com)

  
  
#### Example

This example shows a [CDN update](https://api.gcore.com/docs/cdn) request that activates the User Agents Policy and blocks the requests without a User agent header.
