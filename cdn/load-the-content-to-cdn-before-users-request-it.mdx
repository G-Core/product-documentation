2\. Choose the desired CDN Resource.

3\. In the field write paths to the files without a domain name, e.g. `path/file1.jpg`, that you want to prepopulate to the CDN.

4\. Click on **Prefetch**.

**Important!**

  * Prefetch is recommended only for files that **more than 200 MB and less than 5 GB.**
  * If you need to update files stored in the CDN, first [purge](/cdn/clear-cdn-resource-cache-by-url-pattern-or-all) these files and then prefetch.
  * One request for prefetch may content only up to 100 paths to files.
  * There is only 1 request per minute available.
