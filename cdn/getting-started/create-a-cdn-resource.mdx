title: CDN resource overview
---

The CDN resource is the proxy between Gcore caching edge servers and your website's origin. You should create a CDN resource to enhance the download speed with our infrastructure. 

There are two types of CDN resources available to use with the unique creation wizard:

  * **For the entire site**. Integrate your entire website with our CDN and Managed DNS products. Consult our guide on [configuring a CDN resource for the entire site](/cdn/getting-started/create-a-cdn-resource/create-a-cdn-resource-for-the-entire-site).

  * **For static assets only**. Integrate only static content delivery, such as images and CSS styles. Consult our guide on [configuring a CDN resource for static assets only](/cdn/getting-started/create-a-cdn-resource/create-a-cdn-resource-for-only-static-files).




**Note** : You can create up to thirty CDN resources of both types in a sum. If you need an increase to this limitation, contact your personal manager or support team via [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).
