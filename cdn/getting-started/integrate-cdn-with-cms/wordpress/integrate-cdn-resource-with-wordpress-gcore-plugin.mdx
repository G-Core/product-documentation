Add the paths one by one. The added folders will be displayed in the section.

**Note** : If you do not specify a folder, adding a personal domain indicated in the General section to the URL of files will depend on the file extension.

### Exceptions

Specify URLs of the files that should not be delivered over the CDN in the "Exceptions" section. Add the URLs one by one.

### Plugin workflow

If you want to deliver a file over the CDN, your domain name in the file URL will be replaced with the personal domain that you specified in the General section.

Request processing logic:

  * Is the URL from which the content is requested in the Exceptions section?
    * If yes, the domain name substitution does not occur, the file is distributed as usual.
    * If not, or exceptions are not specified, then check the next point.
  * Is the content in the folder listed under Folders?
    * If yes, the domain name substitution does not occur, the file is distributed as usual.
    * If not, or folders are not specified, then check the next point.
  * Are extensions included in the list of extensions for which the URL changes?
    * If yes, the domain name substitution does not occur, the file is distributed as usual.
    * If yes, then a personal CDN domain is substituted.
