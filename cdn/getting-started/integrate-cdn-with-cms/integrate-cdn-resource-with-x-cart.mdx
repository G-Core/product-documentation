title: Integrate CDN resource with X-Cart
sidebarTitle: X-Cart
---

Before you take any steps please back up your files and database. The plugin works only with default CMS pattern. If you manually changed CMS patterns, the plugin might not help you.

Type in your CNAME that you specified in the [Gcore Customer Portal](https://accounts.gcore.com/reports/dashboard). Assume that you are using  _cdn.example.com_ as CNAME for content delivery. Ensure that your [CNAME record has been configured](/cdn/cdn-resource-options/general/create-and-set-a-custom-domain-for-the-content-delivery-via-cdn) in a proper way before using it for integration.

Integration has been completed! We highly recommend you to check the HTML code of your web page to ensure that URLs have been rewritten properly from your original ones to CNAME from the Gcore Customer Portal.

To do that press **F12** or open Developers Tools in your browser, choose the Network tab and refresh the page. All static files should have your CNAME in URLs.
