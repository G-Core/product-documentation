Before you take any steps please back up your files and database. The plugin works only with default CMS pattern. If you manually changed CMS patterns, the plugin might not help you.

Your system should meet the following requirements:

  * Joomla 3.4.1 or later
  * PHP 5.3.13
  * PHP mbstring (Multibyte String) - should be enabled
  * MySQL 5 or later



## Install the plugin

Download the extension CDN for Joomla! from NoNumber.nl. (you don't need to unpack the file). The extension is for versions after Joomla 3.4.1. If you use Joomla 2, download the CDN for Joomla 2 extension. Login to Joomla administration area.

Integration has been completed! We highly recommend you to check the HTML code of your web page to ensure that URLs have been rewritten properly from your original ones to CNAME from the Gcore Customer Portal.

To do that press **F12** or open Developers Tools in your browser, choose the Network tab and refresh the page. All static files should have your CNAME in URLs.
