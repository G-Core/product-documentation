# Changing Product Visibility

To enable a product, change the product visibility from OFF to ON, confirm the changes, and save the settings.

To disable a product, change the product visibility from ON to OFF. The product must be in one of the following statuses:
- New
- Trialend
- Paused
- Deleted

When you disable a product, all settings for the product will become inactive. Disabled products will no longer appear in the customer's personal account.

Important: If a product is in the Trial or Active status, you will encounter an error. To proceed, first switch the productâ€™s status to Trialend or Paused, and then disable it.

# Interaction with Global Visibility Settings

Once changes are made to a customer's personal visibility settings, the affected products will no longer be influenced by global visibility settings. This ensures that personalized product visibility configurations are retained independently.
