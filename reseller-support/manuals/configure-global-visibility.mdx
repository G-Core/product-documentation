**As the result of switching the global product visibility from OFF to ON** a product is activated for all customers, except customers with individual settings for this product.  

**Switching the global product visibility from ON to OFF** for a product without individual settings is allowed or prohibited depending on the product's status. 

1\. It is allowed to disable a product if it's in the "New", "Trialend", "Paused", or "Deleted" statuses. As a result:

   - A product becomes inactive in personal visibility settings.
   - All settings for this product become inactive in the product tab (Accounts > Account ID  > Product).  
   - Disabled products are not displayed in the customer's Customer Portal. 

2\. It is allowed to disable a product if a product is in "Trial" or "Active" statuses.  Switch its status to "Trialend" or "Paused" before disabling the product and then try again.
