Here you can add your trademark, corporate identity, symbols and contact info when reselling our products. Your company branding will be displayed in the customer's Customer Portal instead of the Gcore one.  

To set up branding, go to the "Branding settings" tab in the "Vendor settings" section.

## Email alerts

This setting allows you to specify email addresses that will receive notifications about your customers' actions: account deletion requests and failed authorization attempts.

**Email for deletion requests.** Here you can enter an email address to receive notifications about status updates of deletion requests. We will automatically send you emails about three events: a customer sends the request, the request is canceled, and the account is deleted. 

**Email for unsuccessful login attempts.** Here you can add an email address to receive notifications about unsuccessful login attempts. This will help you promptly respond to any suspicious activity in the accounts of all admin and Customer Portal users.

To receive emails, turn on the needed toggle and enter your email address into the field. If you want the emails to be sent to multiple email addresses, add them with the "+" button. Don't forget to save the changes.

## SMTP Provider Settings 

This setting allows your customers to receive automatic event notifications about the product they use. For example:  

- the trial period has started, 
- the trial period will end soon, 
- a password has been changed, 
- a new user has been added to the account. 

By default, your customers receive emails sent via a Gcore mail provider from support@gcore.com. If it is ok for you, you do not need to configure anything.  

If you want to send automatic emails from another email address, specify your SMTP server and the address from which the emails should be sent. To do this: 

1\. Open "Branding settings" and make sure the "Base Customer Portal domain" field is filled in. If not, emails will not be sent.

<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/reseller-support/manuals/vendor-settings/vendor-settings-20.png" alt="Branding settings"/>
</Frame>

2\. Go to the "SMTP Provider Settings" tab and enable the "Email for service emails" option. You will see the page with SMTP settings that need to be configured.

<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/reseller-support/manuals/vendor-settings/vendor-settings-30.png" alt="SMTP settings that need to be configured"/>
</Frame>

3\. Configure the following settings:

- Enter the email address that you want to use to send automatic emails to your customers. It will be displayed in the "From" field in emails.   
- Enter the domain of your SMTP server such as smtp.serveraddress.com, or specify its IP address.  
- Enter the port that your SMTP server uses. 

<Tip>
Port 25 is commonly abused to send spam, so some ISPs block this port. If so, some customers may not get your emails via port 25. We recommend using port 465 or 587. 
</Tip>


- Check the "TLS" box if this security protocol for email encryption is enabled on your SMTP server. 
- Enter your username and password of your SMTP server. 

4\. Save changes.  

To make sure that everything is configured properly, send yourself a test email by clicking the "Send test email" button. The email will be sent to your account's primary email address.

## DNSaaS settings

<Frame>

</Frame>

If the DNS product is available for your customers, you can set the values of your primary name server, secondary name server, and email address that will be used to generate SOA records.
This information will be displayed in the customer's Customer Portal when they add a domain name for the DNS zone.

By default, we show Gcore primary and secondary name servers and Gcore email address.

## Products

In the Admin Portal, you can set products that are available to you and also visible to your customers. There are two levels of visibility: global (or default) and personal. 
In the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/reseller-support/manuals/configure-global-visibility" target="_blank">global visibility</a> settings, you can set the visibility of products for all your customers.

<Frame>

</Frame>

In the <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/reseller-support/manuals/configure-personal-visibility" target="_blank">personal visibility</a> settings, you can enable or disable the visibility of products for a particular customer. The visibility statuses of personally configured products will not be available for changes from the global visibility settings. 

<Tip>
If you have activated **Video Streaming** product for your customers, note that each customer on the trial plan will automatically get access to one live stream.
