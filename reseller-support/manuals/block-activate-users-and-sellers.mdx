## What is the "Block" feature?

The <a href="https://admin.gcore.top/" target="_blank">new Admin Portal's</a> "Block" feature allows you to block sellers, which is an effective tool for managing access to the Admin Portal and maintaining a secure and trustworthy community of consumers.

<Note>
All requests to the Admin Portal API, including authorization tokens, password recovery, and activation requests, are prohibited.
</Note>

The blocking restrictions will remain in effect until you cancel them with the "Activate" feature.

## Block or activate a seller

1\. Go to the <a href="https://admin.gcore.top/users/sellers" target="_blank">Sellers</a> section in the Admin Portal.

The new page will open, and you can do the remaining steps there.

2\. Find the seller you need using the filters.

3\. Scroll the page on the right and click the three dots.

4\. Select **Block**.

The seller will be blocked.

Click **Activate** if you need to unblock the seller in step #4.
