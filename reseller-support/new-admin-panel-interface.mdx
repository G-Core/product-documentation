The new Admin Portal is an improved dashboard for managing accounts and sellers, viewing reports, and configuring settings such as branding and product visibility.

Compared to the previous version of the admin panel, the new one retains all essential functions while adding new features, such as quick filters and presets for better searching and filtering. The new Admin Portal also has a more user-friendly interface.

## New features of the new Admin Portal  

We have described all-important new features. If there is a feature you are interested in that is not mentioned, please send a request to the [Gcore support team](mailto:support@gcore.com). 

### Quick filters

We have added quick filters by Account ID, email, name, company name, and customer status to make searching more flexible.

### Search presets 

We have added the ability to create presets for your search. With this feature, you can save filters to quickly apply them to future searches without having to recreate them each time.

To create a preset:

1\. Open the "Accounts" section and click **Add filter**.

2\. Choose the necessary filters from the list, add the conditions, and click **Apply** filter. We suggest different filters in addition to the quick filters listed on the page. Applied filters will be added to the page. For example, we added filters by only real accounts (not tested) and CDN status "New":
