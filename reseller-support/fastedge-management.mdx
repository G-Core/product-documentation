description: Explore our guide to FastEdge applications and templates management.
---

In the Gcore Admin Panel, you can manage two types of FastEdge applications and their corresponding templates: 

* **HTTP applications**: Manage your cloud applications deployed on edge servers across the global Gcore CDN network. 

* **CDN applications**: Manage FastEdge applications integrated with Gcore CDN infrastructure to extend the CDN functionality.  

## Manage FastEdge applications

The **HTTP Applications** and **CDN Applications** pages contain information about all FastEdge apps created and used by your customers.

### Filter data in the applications table

You can filter application data based on the following criteria: 

* **Client ID**. A unique identifier for the customer account where the application was created. 

* **Status**. The current state of the application: 

  * **Active**: The application is up and running.

  * **Disabled**: The application is stopped.

* **Template ID**. A unique identifier for the template used to create the application. If this column is empty, it indicates that the application was created without a template. 

* **Binary ID**. A unique identifier for the binary file from which the application was created. Useful for distinguishing different versions of an app built from the same template.

* **Plan**: The subscription plan according to which the application is billed. This is typically determined by the customer’s plan.

### Configure columns in the applications table 

The applications table displays the following information about FastEdge apps: 

* **ID**: A unique identifier for the application. This information can be useful for diagnostic purposes and troubleshooting. If you encounter issues with a specific app and require assistance from our support team, we recommend providing the app ID in your support request. 

* **Name**: The application name specified in the Customer Portal during application creation. 

* **Upgradable**: If the column shows **Outdated**, this means that the application was created from a template and is using an old version of the binary. In this case, it’s best to <a href="https://gcore.com/docs/reseller-support/fastedge-management#upgrade-a-binary-version" target="_blank">update the application</a> to the newest version.  

* **URL** (HTTP applications only): Link to the deployed HTTP application. 

* **Reseller**: The ID of a reseller account where the application was created. 

* **Description**: If your customer provided a description when creating the application in the Customer Portal, the description will appear in this column.  

### Stop or activate an application

1\. Open the relevant page: **HTTP Applications** or **CDN Applications**. 

2\. Find the application that you want to manage and click the three-dot icon next to it. 

3\. Select the required action: **Stop** or **Start**.

<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/reseller-support/fastedge-management/stop-app.png" alt="Application settings menu with stop button highlighted" width="80%"/>
</Frame>

The application status will be changed respectively, and the changes will also be reflected in the Customer Portal, where your customers can also stop or start the application. 

### Upgrade a binary version 

Sometimes, you might see the **Outdated** status in the **Upgradeable** column. This status is only relevant to applications created from templates, and it means that the template has been updated.  

If this happens, we recommend upgrading the application binary to the newest template version to get the latest improvements and security fixes: 

1\. Open the relevant page: **HTTP Applications** or **CDN Applications**. 

2\. Find the application that you want to update and click the three-dot icon next to it. 

3\. Click **Upgrade binary version**.

<Frame>
<img src="https://assets.gcore.pro/docs/reseller-support/fastedge-management/upgrade-app.png" alt="Application settings menu with upgrade button highlighted" width="80%"/>
</Frame>

Your application’s binary has been upgraded to the latest version.

### Delete an application

To delete an application:

The templates table displays the following information:

* **Description**: If your customer provided a description when creating the template in the Customer Portal, the description will appear in this column. 

* **Instructions**: Guidelines for using the template (if those were provided in the Customer Portal). 

### Share or unshare a template 

Sharing a template makes it accessible to all your customers in the Customer Portal. They will be able to view it in the templates list and create FastEdge applications from this template. 

To use the template sharing options: 

1\. Open the relevant template page, either under the **HTTP Applications** or **CDN Applications**. 

2\. Find the needed template and click the three-dot icon next to it. 

3\. Click **Share template** or **Unshare template**.

</Frame>

Shared templates have the group ID specified in the table. If the **Group ID** column is empty, this means that the template isn’t shared with your customers, and they can’t see it in the Customer Portal. 

### Delete a template

If you delete a template, it will be removed from the Customer Portal and you won’t be able to restore it back. You’ll need to upload the template again. 

To delete a template:

2\. Find the template that you want to remove and click the three-dot icon next to it.
