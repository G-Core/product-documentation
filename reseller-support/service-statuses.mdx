## Product status

### New

The status is applied to customers who sign up via our website before they confirm the registration via email. You register your customers yourself, so they won't have this status.

### Trial

When a customer is created from the Admin Portal, the Trial status is applied. The customer receives an email about the trial start. The trial settings can be changed in the Admin Portal.

### TrialEnd

When the trial ends, the product is switched to the TrialEnd status automatically. All the product resources get suspended. The customer will receive an email about the end of the trial period.

### Active

If the customer signs a contract with you, change the product status to Active manually before the trial ends and the client's products get suspended.

### Paused

If you want to temporarily suspend the customer, use the Paused status. All of the product resources will be paused.

### Deleted

This status is connected to the Transition to Deleted status setting. The Deleted status is set automatically once the specified number of days is over. When the Status is switched, the product resources get deleted. You cannot change the number of days yourself. To change the number of days for a specific customer, email us at [support@gcore.com](mailto:support@gcore.com).
