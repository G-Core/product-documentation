The CDN section collects information about your customers who use CDN and the resources they utilize. It includes the subsections Accounts, CDN resources, Activity Logs, and Origin Groups.

## Customers

This subsection provides details about customers who have created CDN resources. Each entry includes:

- The customer’s account ID
- The CDN resource custom domain
- The email associated with the account
- The company name
- The date the CDN resource was created
- The CDN resource ID, along with custom domains and traffic data
- The amount of incoming traffic
- A list of paid features activated for the CDN resources
- The CDN resource status (e.g., “New,” “Trial,” “Trial End,” “Active,” “Paused,” “Activating,” “Deleted”) 

You can apply filters to manage specific entries. By default, only CDN resources with an “Active” status are displayed. 

Click three-dot icon on the right to edit a customer's settings.
