In order to interact with the Gcore API, you need to have a registered account.
<Note>[Sign up](https://auth.gcore.com/login/signup) if you don't have one.</Note>

The majority of methods require an API token in the Authorization header. An API token is a unique key that all users and applications should add to requests in order to interact with our services.

## Bearer
The **access token** will be provided upon Login request. This method is available only for users who log in using email address and password. Use API tokens if using social networks (Google, GitHub) to log in. You can send this request no more than 5 times per second. In addition to authentication, the API checks if the user is authorized to perform the requested action.

In the response you will get two tokens: **access** and **refresh**.

Provide your **access** token in the Authorization header.

Example: ```curl 'https://api.gcore.com/iam/users' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV'```

Use the Refresh request to refresh your access token.

## API key
You can also use a [permanent API token](#tag/API-Tokens) for regular automated requests to services via API.

Provide your APIKey in the Authorization header.

Example: ```curl 'https://api.gcore.com/iam/users' -H 'Authorization: APIKey 123$61b8e1e7a68c' ```
