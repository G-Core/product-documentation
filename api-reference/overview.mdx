# Gcore API Overview

Gcore is a global edge-cloud and security provider with **180+ Points of Presence on six continents**. Every product you see in the [Gcore Product Documentation](/home) is backed by a public, REST-style API so you can automate everything you do in the Customer Portal â€” or build entirely new experiences of your own.

## Why build on the API?

* **Automate** routine tasks such as CDN cache purges, DNS record updates, or VM provisioning.
* **Integrate** Gcore services into CI/CD pipelines, Terraform workflows, Kubernetes Operators, or custom back-office tools.
* **Monitor & react** to real-time metrics or events and keep your infrastructure in a desired state.

Whether youâ€™re shipping a simple web app or operating a multi-region SaaS platform, Gcoreâ€™s APIs give you the same programmatic control used internally by our portal and SDKs.

## Base URLs by product

| Service | Base URL |
|---------|----------|
| Identity & Access Management (IAM) | `https://api.gcore.com/iam` |
| Content Delivery Network (CDN) | `https://api.gcore.com/cdn` |
| Managed DNS | `https://api.gcore.com/dns` |
| Cloud, GPU Cloud & AI Inference | `https://api.gcore.com/cloud` |
| Object Storage | `https://api.gcore.com/storage` |
| FastEdge (Edge Functions) | `https://api.gcore.com/fastedge` |
| Video Streaming | `https://api.gcore.com/streaming` |
| DDoS | `https://api.gcore.com/security/iaas` |
| WAAP | `https://api.gcore.com/waap` |

## Authentication

1. Sign in to the **Customer Portal â†’ [API tokens](https://portal.gcore.com/accounts/profile/api-tokens)**.
2. Create a token (optionally set an expiry or rotate it later).
3. Send the token as an *APIKey* in the `Authorization` header:

```http
GET https://api.gcore.com/iam/clients/me
Authorization: APIKey <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

The same header works for every product API.

<Warning>Gcore API keys always contain a dollar sign (`$`). When you paste the key directly into a terminal,
    escape the dollar sign (`\$`) so your shell doesn't treat it as the start of an environment variable.</Warning>

## Quick start (cURL)

Get detailed information about your account

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: APIKey $GCORE_TOKEN" "https://api.gcore.com/iam/clients/me"
```

The command should return `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.
